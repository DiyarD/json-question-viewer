            "explanation": "- Gynecomastia is very common in men and typically seen at 3 time points: infancy, puberty, and advanced age.\n- Pubertal gynecomastia is primarily due to an imbalance of androgenic and estrogenic influence on breast tissue, with an altered serum androgen-to-estrogen ratio.\n- As puberty progresses, this ratio corrects, and gynecomastia resolves as androgen secretion dominates.\n- In a boy of this age, the process is self-limited, and there is no indication for breast imaging with either ultrasound or mammogram.\n- Male breast cancer typically does not present at this age.\n- The management of this patient is observation.\n- Gynecomastia can also result from alcohol, marijuana, or other drugs and is reversible with discontinuation.\n- Hormonal manipulation with tamoxifen (an antiestrogen) or danazol (an antiandrogen) is not appropriate given the patient's age and the self-limited nature of pubertal gynecomastia."

            "explanation": "- A recent review and meta-analysis showed that contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) does not offer a survival benefit for patients with unilateral breast cancer and no heritable mutations.\n- For this group, the risk of metachronous contralateral breast cancer is already low and likely does not warrant the morbidity of CPM.\n- According to the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial, tamoxifen reduced breast cancer incidence among BRCA2 patients by 62% but did not reduce breast cancer incidence in patients with BRCA1 mutations.\n- Among male patients with the BRCA1 mutation, the lifetime risk of breast cancer is 1.2%; there is no documented evidence that prophylactic mastectomy reduces this risk.\n- Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not universally recommended for patients undergoing CPM, though some authors suggest it may benefit patients with an extremely high risk for invasive cancer (e.g., inflammatory carcinoma history) and that patients should be stratified by MRI evaluation before CPM.\n- Multiple studies indicate that nipple-sparing mastectomy is an acceptable choice for patients with BRCA mutations undergoing prophylactic mastectomy, with no diminishment in the oncologic effectiveness of the procedure."

            "explanation": "- Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) are part of a breast disease spectrum referred to as lobular hyperplasia.\n- A diagnosis of LCIS is associated with an 8-to-10-fold increased risk of breast cancer, which is equal in both breasts and not increased in the breast found to have LCIS.\n- LCIS is not a direct precursor of invasive lobular carcinoma.\n- Breast cancer screening in patients known to have LCIS should include annual mammogram, and breast MRI can be added in some high-risk patients.\n- This patient is best treated by a lumpectomy followed by raloxifene.\n- Lumpectomy is recommended to evaluate all adjacent breast tissue not sampled with core biopsy, unless LCIS is found incidentally on core biopsy and another pathology explains the imaging finding.\n- Pharmacologic interventions such as tamoxifen and raloxifene decrease the incidence of subsequent invasive, hormone-positive breast cancers in patients with known LCIS; tamoxifen is typically used in premenopausal patients and raloxifene in postmenopausal patients.\n- Patients with LCIS are not recommended to undergo radiation after surgery as LCIS is a risk marker, not true breast carcinoma, and does not metastasize to axillary nodes; therefore, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not warranted.\n- Unilateral mastectomy will not sufficiently decrease risk of subsequent breast cancer, as LCIS increases the risk of bilateral breast cancer."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- Core needle biopsy allows many asymptomatic patients to avoid surgical excision when findings are benign; further management depends on pathology.\n- Patients with benign core biopsy should have further evaluation if findings are symptomatic or portend an increased risk for breast cancer.\n- Of the listed lesions, only atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is routinely recommended for excisional biopsy.\n- ADH is localized intraductal proliferation with many features similar to low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and often presents as visible microcalcifications on imaging.\n- Differentiation between ADH and DCIS from a core biopsy sample can be difficult.\n- Approximately 10% to 20% of ADH cases are upgraded to DCIS after excisional biopsy, making excision critical for obtaining the correct final diagnosis.\n- Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that often present clinically as a mobile, palpable mass; biopsy-proven fibroadenomas do not require excision unless they have pathologic atypia, are rapidly growing, or are symptomatic.\n- Sclerosing adenosis is a benign lesion not associated with an increased risk of cancer or pathologic upgrade; excision or increased screening is not warranted.\n- Fat necrosis is a benign lesion often appearing after trauma or breast surgery; it does not infer an increased risk of breast cancer and does not need to be surgically excised.\n- Pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasia (PASH) is a benign proliferative lesion that does not increase breast cancer risk and does not need to be surgically excised."

            "explanation": "- Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial breast tumors (approx. 1% of all breast malignancies), typically presenting as enlarging mobile breast masses.\n- Work-up includes mammogram and ultrasound; they often appear benign and are often misdiagnosed as fibroadenomas.\n- Core biopsy before surgical excision is not always definitive due to high tumor heterogeneity; histologic diagnosis is most accurate after entire mass evaluation.\n- Treatment of phyllodes tumors starts with surgical excision.\n- If final pathologic evaluation reveals phyllodes tumor, a 1-cm margin of benign tissue is generally recommended, which can be accomplished with re-excision of the seroma cavity.\n- Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy are reasonable options for initial management if tumor-to-breast size ratio allows for a 1-cm margin.\n- Margins of less than 1 cm result in higher local recurrence rates.\n- Due to the very low incidence of axillary nodal metastases, axillary staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary node dissection are not indicated in patients with phyllodes tumors.\n- Neoadjuvant therapy does not change surgical management or affect survival/recurrence rates.\n- Indications for adjuvant therapy are not clearly defined, and neither chemotherapy nor radiation is routinely recommended.\n- Radiation therapy may be indicated for tumors larger than 2 cm after breast-conserving surgery or very large tumors (>10 cm) after mastectomy; it may improve local disease control but not survival."

            "explanation": "- Pathology reports should list margins in quantitative measurements rather than categories like close, negative, and positive.\n- Breast conservation specimens should be oriented at the time of surgery to allow for proper margin evaluation and to determine the necessity for re-excision.\n- A margin at the fibroglandular border (skin, pectoralis fascia) does not need re-excision; residual remaining breast tissue should be re-excised.\n- A negative margin is defined as no ink on tumor for invasive breast cancer and is endorsed by the Society of Surgical Oncology and the American Society for Radiation Oncology.\n- LCIS is now reported as classic LCIS or pleomorphic LCIS. Classic LCIS is considered a high-risk lesion treated as benign that does not require surgical removal with a negative margin.\n- The significance of pleomorphic LCIS at the margin is uncertain, but some guidelines advocate for a 2 mm margin, similar to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n- Consensus guidelines for margins in breast conserving surgery for DCIS with whole breast radiation recommend a 0.2-cm margin as standard, associated with lower rates of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence.\n- A positive margin is defined as DCIS on inked margin and is associated with an increased risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence.\n- It is not necessary to regularly perform surgery to obtain greater than 0.2-cm margin for DCIS treated with whole breast radiation.\n- For DCIS treated with excision alone, the optimal margin is not known but is suggested to be at least 0.2 cm.\n- Re-excision of close (<2 mm) or positive margins should be selectively used."
