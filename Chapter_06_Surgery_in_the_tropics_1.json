Rupture of the abscess causes peritonitis and shock. A chronic granuloma, called an amoeboma, may form, commonly on the right side of the colon, where the patient has had a long history of repeated indiscriminate and inadequate self-medication. This condition may mimic a carcinoma. When a patient is from an endemic background with a history of altered bowel habit and a right-sided lesion, an amoeboma should be suspected; it is imperative to exclude a carcinoma. The two conditions often co-exist; therefore, it is mandatory to take repeat biopsies on colonoscopy after adequate treatment."

After treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole, diloxanide furoate, which is not effective against hepatic infestation, is used for 10 days to destroy any residual intestinal infestation. Aspiration not only prevents rupture, but also promotes the penetration of amoebicidal drugs. Surgery is carried out for complications of amoebiasis. However, the general principles of vigorous resuscitation must be applied to these very sick patients."

The biopsy should be adequate, contain grains and be fixed immediately in 10% formal saline. Deep biopsy is obtained under general or regional anaesthesia, although the chance of local spread is high. In Type I, a layer of polymorphonuclear leukocytes usually surrounds the grains. In Type II tissue reaction, the neutrophils largely disappear and are replaced by macrophages and multinucleated giant cells which engulf grain material. Type III reaction is characterised by the formation of a well-organised epithelioid granuloma with Langhan's type giant cells. The centre of the granuloma sometimes contains remnants of fungal material. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can yield an accurate diagnosis and helps in distinguishing between eumycetoma and actinomycetoma. The common serodiagnostic tests are immunoelectrophoresis and ELISA, while culture can be used to isolate and grow the microorganisms."

            "explanation": "Management of this condition should be a team effort between the physician and surgeon. In actinomycetoma, combined drug therapy with amikacin sulphate and co-trimoxazole in cycles is the treatment of choice. Amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, rifampicin, sulphonamides, gentamicin and kanamycin are used as a second line of treatment. Long-term drug treatment may have serious side effects. In eumycetoma, ketoconazole, intraconazole and voriconazole are the drugs of choice. They may need to be used for up to 1 year. Use of these drugs should be monitored closely by the physician for side effects. While not curative, these drugs help to localise the disease by forming thickly encapsulated lesions which are then amenable to surgical excision. Medical treatment for both types of mycetoma must continue until the patient is cured and also in the postoperative period. Surgery is indicated in small, localized lesions, resistance to medical treatment, or for better response after medical treatment in patients with massive disease. Excision may need to be much more extensive than suggested at first on clinical appearance, because the disease may extend to deeper planes that are not clinically apparent. The surgical options are wide, local and debulking excisions and amputations. Amputation, used as a life-saving procedure, is indicated in advanced mycetoma refractory to medical treatment with severe secondary bacterial infection. The amputation rate is 10% to 25%. Postoperative medical treatment should continue for an adequate period to prevent recurrence, local or regional, which is 25% to 50%. Recurrence is usually due to inadequate treatment."

            "explanation": "1. J Actinomycetoma Of the two types of mycetoma, actinomycetoma is characterised by earlier and more extensive invasion of deeper tissues as compared with eumycetoma. The swelling is variable in its physical characteristics, which are firm and rounded, soft and lobulated, rarely cystic and often mobile. Multiple secondary nodules may evolve; they may suppurate and drain through multiple sinus tracts. The sinuses may close transiently after discharge during the active phase of the disease. Fresh adjacent sinuses may open, while some of the old ones may heal completely. They coalesce and form abscesses, the discharge being serous, serosanguinous, or purulent. During the active phase of the disease the sinuses discharge grains, the colour of which can be black, yellow, white, or red depending upon the organism. Pain occurs when there is secondary bacterial infection. Local spread occurs predominantly along tissue planes. The organism multiplies, forming colonies that spread along the fascial planes to skin and underlying structures. Lymphatic spread occurs to the regional lymph nodes. During the active phase of the disease, these lymphatic satellites may suppurate and discharge. Lymphatic spread is more common in actinomycetoma; lymphadenopathy may also be due to secondary bacterial infection. Spread by bloodstream can occur. X-ray may show multiple large cavities with well-defined margins and periosteal reaction typical of eumycetoma. Periosteal reaction with new bone spicules may create a sun-ray appearance and Codman's triangle, not unlike in osteogenic sarcoma. However, clinical appearance is completely different in the latter where bony swelling rather than subcutaneous nodules are the predominant picture. MRI of the involved joint usually shows multiple 2â€“5 mm lesions of high signal intensity, which indicates the granuloma, interspersed within a low-intensity matrix denoting the fibrous tissue. The â€˜dot-in-circle sign', which indicates the presence of grains, is highly characteristic. Kaposi sarcoma may be associated with swollen foot, multiple soft tissue nodules and destruction of the bones of the foot, making it sometimes difficult to differentiate from mycetoma.\n2. B Amoebic liver abscess Amoebiasis is caused by Entamoeba histolytica. The disease is common in the Indian subcontinent, Africa and parts of Central and South America where almost half the population is infected. The majority remain asymptomatic carriers. Amoebic liver abscess, the most common extraintestinal manifestation, occurs in less than 10% of the infected population and, in endemic areas, is much more common than pyogenic abscess. The typical patient with amoebic liver abscess is a young adult male with a history of pain and fever and insidious onset of non-specific symptoms such as anorexia, fever, night sweats, malaise, cough and weight loss, which gradually progress to more specific symptoms of pain in the right upper abdomen, shoulder-tip pain, hiccoughs and a non-productive cough. A past history of bloody diarrhoea or travel to an endemic area raises the index of suspicion. Examination reveals a patient who is toxic and anaemic. The patient will have upper abdominal rigidity, tender hepatomegaly, tender and bulging intercostal spaces, overlying skin oedema, pleural effusion and basal pneumonitis â€“ the last feature being a late manifestation. Occasionally, a tinge of jaundice or ascites may be present. Rarely, the patient may present as an emergency due to the effects of rupture into the peritoneal, pleural, or pericardial cavity.\n3. L Ascariasis Ascaris lumbricoides, commonly called the roundworm, is the most common intestinal nematode to infect humans and affects one-quarter of the world's population. The parasite causes pulmonary symptoms as a larva and intestinal symptoms as an adult worm. The adult worm can grow up to 45 cm long. Its presence in the small intestine causes malnutrition, failure to thrive and abdominal pain. Small intestinal obstruction can occur, particularly in children, due to a bolus of adult worms incarcerated in the terminal ileum. This is a surgical emergency. Rarely, perforation of the small bowel may occur as a result of ischaemic pressure necrosis from the bolus of worms. A high index of suspicion is necessary so as not to miss the diagnosis. If a person from the tropics, or one who has recently returned from an endemic area, presents with pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic symptoms, roundworm infestation should be high on the list of possible diagnoses. Increase in the eosinophil count is common, in keeping with most other parasitic infestations. Stool examination may show ova. Sputum or bronchoscopic washings may show Charcot-Leyden crystals or the larvae.\n4. F Filariasis Filariasis is chiefly caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, which is carried by the mosquito. A variant of the parasite called Brugia malayi and Brugia timori is responsible for causing the disease in about 10% of sufferers. The condition affects more than 90 million people worldwide, two-thirds of who live in India, China and Indonesia. It is chiefly males who are affected, because females in general cover a greater part of their bodies, thus making them less prone to mosquito bites. In the acute presentation, there are episodic attacks of fever with lymphadenitis and lymphangitis. Occasionally, adult worms may be felt subcutaneously. Chronic manifestations appear after repeated acute attacks over several years. The adult worms cause lymphatic obstruction, resulting in massive lower limb oedema. Obstruction to the cutaneous lymphatics causes skin thickening, not unlike the 'peau d'orange' appearance in breast cancer, thus exacerbating the limb swelling. Secondary streptococcal infection is common. Recurrent attacks of lymphangitis cause fibrosis of the lymph channels, resulting in a grossly swollen limb with thickened skin, producing the condition of elephantiasis. Bilateral lower limb filariasis is often associated with scrotal and penile elephantiasis. Early on, there may be a hydrocele underlying scrotal filariasis. Eosinophilia is common, and a nocturnal peripheral blood smear may show the immature forms or microfilariae. The parasite may also be seen in chylous urine, ascites and hydrocele fluid.\n5. C Hydatid disease Commonly called dog tapeworm, hydatid disease is caused by Echinococcus granulosus. While it is common in the tropics, in the United Kingdom the occasional patient may come from a rural sheep farming community. The dog is the definitive host and, as a pet, is the most common source of infection transmitted to the intermediate hosts, including humans, sheep and cattle. As the parasite can colonise virtually every organ in the body, the condition can be protean in its presentation. When a sheep farmer, who is otherwise healthy, complains of a gradually enlarging painful mass in the right upper quadrant with the physical findings of a liver swelling, a hydatid liver cyst should be considered. The liver is the organ most often affected. The lungs are the next site most commonly affected. The parasite can affect any organ or several organs in the same patient. The disease may be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally at postmortem or when an ultrasound or CT scan is done for some other condition. Symptomatic disease presents with a swelling causing pressure effects. Thus, a hepatic lesion causes dull pain from stretching of the liver capsule, and a pulmonary lesion, if large enough, causes dyspnoea.\n6. D Hyperplastic ileocaecal tuberculosis Infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is common in the tropics. Any patient, particularly one who has recently arrived from an endemic area and who has features of generalised ill health and altered bowel habit, should arouse the suspicion of intestinal tuberculosis. Patients present electively with weight loss, chronic cough, malaise, evening rise in temperature with sweating, vague abdominal pain with distension and alternating constipation and diarrhoea. As an emergency, they present with features of distal small-bowel obstruction from strictures of the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Rarely, a patient may present with features of peritonitis from perforation of a tuberculous ulcer in the small bowel. Examination shows a chronically ill patient with a â€˜doughy' feel to the abdomen from areas of localised ascites. In the hyperplastic type, a mass may be felt in the right iliac fossa. Some patients may present late as an emergency from intestinal obstruction. Abdominal pain and distension, constipation and bilious and faeculent vomiting are typical of such a patient who is in extremis. Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), anaemia and a positive Mantoux test are usual, although the last is not significant in a patient from an endemic area. Sputum for culture and sensitivity (the result may take several weeks) and staining by the Ziehl-Neelsen method for acid-fast bacilli (the result is obtained much earlier) should be done. A barium meal and follow-through (or small-bowel enema) will show strictures of the small bowel, particularly the ileum, typically with a high subhepatic caecum with the narrow ileum entering the caecum directly from below upward in a straight line rather than at an angle. In the patient presenting as an emergency, urea and electrolytes show evidence of gross dehydration. Plain abdominal x-ray shows typical small-bowel obstructionâ€“ valvulae conniventes of dilated jejunum and featureless ileum with evidence of fluid between the loops.\n7. G Leprosy Leprosy, also called Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the acid-fast bacillus, Mycobacterium leprae that is widely prevalent in the tropics. Globally, India, Brazil, Nepal, Mozambique, Angola and Myanmar (Burma) account for 91% of all the cases. The disease is broadly classified into two groups, lepromatous and tuberculoid. In lepromatous leprosy, there is widespread dissemination of abundant bacilli in the tissue with macrophages and a few lymphocytes. This is a reflection of the poor immune response, resulting in depleted host resistance from the patient. In tuberculoid leprosy, on the other hand, the patient shows a strong immune response with scant bacilli in the tissues, epithelioid granulomas, numerous lymphocytes and giant cells. The tissue damage is proportional to the host's immune response. The disease is slowly progressive and affects the skin, upper respiratory tract and peripheral nerves. In tuberculoid leprosy, the damage to tissue occurs early and is localised to one part of the body with limited deformity of that organ. Neural involvement is characterised by thickening of the nerves, which are tender. There may be asymmetric well-defined anaesthetic hypopigmented or erythematous macules with elevated edges and a dry and rough surface â€“ lesions called leprids. In lepromatous leprosy, the disease is symmetrical and extensive. Cutaneous involvement occurs in the form of several pale macules that form plaques and nodules called lepromas. The deformities produced are divided into primary, which are caused by leprosy or its reactions, and secondary, which result from effects such as anaesthesia of the hands and feet. There is loss of eyebrows and destruction of the lateral cartilages and septum of the nose with collapse of the nasal bridge and lifting of the tip of the nose. There may be paralysis of the branches of the facial nerve in the bony canal or the zygomatic branch. The hands are typically clawed because of involvement of the ulnar nerve at the elbow and the median nerve at the wrist. Anaesthesia of the hands makes these patients vulnerable to frequent burns and injuries. Similarly, clawing of the toes occurs as a result of involvement of the posterior tibial nerve. When the lateral popliteal nerve is affected, it leads to foot drop, and the nerve can be felt to be thickened behind the upper end of the fibula. Anaesthesia of the feet predisposes to trophic ulceration, chronic infection, contraction and auto-amputation. Involvement of the testes causes atrophy, which in turn results in gynaecomastia.\n8. H Poliomyelitis Poliomyelitis is an enteroviral infection that affects children in developing countries. The virus enters the body by inhalation or ingestion. Clinically, the disease manifests itself in a wide spectrum of symptoms, from a few days of mild fever and headache to the extreme variety consisting of extensive paralysis of the bulbar form that may not be compatible with life because of involvement of the respiratory and pharyngeal muscles. The disease targets the anterior horn cells, causing lower motor neuron paralysis. Muscles of the lower limb are affected twice as frequently as those of the upper limb. Only 1% to 2% of sufferers develop paralytic symptoms, but, when they do occur, the disability causes much misery. When a patient develops fever with muscle weakness, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome needs to be excluded. The latter has sensory symptoms and signs, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis should help to differentiate the two conditions. The regional anatomical deformities are as follows: Foot and ankle: The most common deformities are claw toes, cavovarus foot, dorsal bunion, talipes equines, talipes equinovarus, talipes cavovarus, talipes equinovalgus and talipes calcaneus. Knee: Flexion contracture, quadriceps paralysis, genu recurvatum and flail knee. Hip: Common problems are flexion and abduction contractures, hip instability due to paralysis of the gluteal muscles and paralytic hip dislocation. Trunk: Unbalanced paralysis causes scoliosis along with pelvic obliquity. Shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand: Common problems are shoulder weakness, wrist drop and claw hands.\n9. I Psoas abscess Psoas abscess is a condition in which an abscess develops in the fascial sheath of the psoas major muscle. The source of infection may be from the adjacent lumbar vertebrae (tuberculosis of the spine is the most common), haematogenous, or from the overlying peritoneal cavity. The abscess remains silent for a long time due to the deep-seated location of the muscle. At this time the patient may have systemic features of the infection, such as fever or malaise, or may have symptoms attributable to the spine such as backache or neurological complaints. The infection tracks along the muscle sheath and may involve the iliacus muscle, which joins the psoas for a common insertion, to form an iliopsoas abscess. This may be palpable as a lump in the iliac fossa. Rarely, the abscess may point on the medial side of the thigh at the point of insertion of the muscle on the femur. The affected muscle may go into spasm, causing flexion deformity of the hip joint. Clinical signs may include tenderness of the affected vertebrae, fullness of the paravertebral space and scoliosis with concavity toward the affected side, mass in the iliac fossa, flexion deformity of the hip and lump on the upper medial thigh with cross-fluctuation of the abscess (cold abscess). An x-ray of the dorsolumbar spine or US or CT scan help in arriving at a diagnosis.\n10. A Tropical chronic pancreatitis Tropical chronic pancreatitis is a disease affecting the younger generation seen mostly in southern India. The aetiology remains obscure, with malnutrition, dietary, familial and genetic factors being possible causes. Cassava (tapioca) is a root vegetable that is readily available and inexpensive and is therefore consumed as a staple diet. Several members of the same family have been known to suffer from this condition; this strengthens the theory that cassava toxicity is an important cause, because family members eat the same food. The patient, usually male, is almost always younger than 40 years and usually from a poor background. The clinical presentation is abdominal pain, thirst, polyuria and features of gross pancreatic insufficiency, causing steatorrhoea and malnutrition. The patient looks ill and emaciated. Initial routine blood and urine tests confirm that the patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Plain abdominal x-ray shows typical pancreatic calcification in the form of discrete stones in the duct. Ultrasound and CT scan of the pancreas confirm the diagnosis.\n11. K Tubercular peritonitis Infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is common in the tropics. Any patient, particularly one who has recently arrived from an endemic area and who has features of generalised ill health and altered bowel habit, should arouse the suspicion of intestinal tuberculosis. Patients present electively with weight loss, chronic cough, malaise, evening rise in temperature with sweating, vague abdominal pain with abdominal distension and alternating constipation and diarrhoea. As an emergency, they present with features of distal small-bowel obstruction from strictures of the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Rarely, a patient may present with features of peritonitis from perforation of a tuberculous ulcer in the small bowel. Examination shows a chronically ill patient with a â€˜doughy' feel to the abdomen from areas of localised ascites. In the hyperplastic type, a mass may be felt in the right iliac fossa. Because this is a disease seen mainly in developing countries, patients may present late as an emergency from intestinal obstruction. Abdominal pain and distension, constipation and bilious and faeculent vomiting are typical of such a patient who is in extremis. Raised ESR and CRP, low haemoglobin and a positive Mantoux test are usual, although the last is not significant in a patient from an endemic area. Sputum for culture and sensitivity (the result may take several weeks) and staining by the Ziehl-Neelsen method for acid-fast bacilli (the result is obtained much earlier) should be done. A barium meal and follow-through (or small-bowel enema) will show strictures of the small bowel, particularly the ileum, typically with a high subhepatic caecum with the narrow ileum entering the caecum directly from below upward in a straight line rather than at an angle. In the patient presenting as an emergency, urea and electrolytes show evidence of gross dehydration. Plain abdominal x-ray shows typical small-bowel obstruction â€“ valvulae conniventes of dilated jejunum and featureless ileum with evidence of fluid between the loops.\n12. E Typhoid perforation Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi, which is also called the typhoid bacillus. This is a Gram-negative organism. The organism gains entry into the human gastrointestinal tract as a result of poor hygiene and inadequate sanitation. It is a disease normally managed by physicians, but the surgeon is called upon to treat the patient with typhoid fever because of perforation of a typhoid ulcer. A typical patient is from an endemic area or someone who has recently visited such a country and suffers from a high temperature for 2 to 3 weeks. The patient may be toxic with abdominal distension from paralytic ileus. The patient may have melaena due to haemorrhage from a typhoid ulcer; this can lead to hypovolaemia. In the second or third week of the illness, if there is severe generalised abdominal pain, this heralds a perforated typhoid ulcer. The patient, who is already very ill, deteriorates further with classical features of peritonitis. An erect chest x-ray or a lateral decubitus film (in the very ill, as they usually are) will show free gas in the peritoneal cavity. In fact, any patient being treated for typhoid fever who shows a sudden deterioration accompanied by abdominal signs should be considered to have a typhoid perforation until proved otherwise."
