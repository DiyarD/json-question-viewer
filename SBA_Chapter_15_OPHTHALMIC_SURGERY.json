            "question": "A 40-year-old woman presents complaining that her right eye hurts and that she cannot tolerate the bright light in the room. She is protecting her right eye with her hand. There is no history of trauma or foreign body. Visual acuity is reduced in the right eye. Examination reveals redness at the junction between the cornea and sclera of the right eye. The right pupil appears small. Slit lamp examination reveals a collection of cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. What is the most likely cause of this woman's symptoms?",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This patient has anterior uveitis or iritis. This condition leads to eye pain, redness, excessive tearing, photophobia, visual loss in late stages and a constricted pupil due to spasm of the papillary sphincter. The presence of a hypopyon (pus deposition from leucocytes) in the anterior chamber on slit lamp assessment helps differentiate iritis from other causes of acute red eye. Approximately 50% of cases are primary and of unknown origin whilst the remainder may be associated with certain sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis and autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sarcoidosis. If an underlying cause is found, it must be treated but due to the frequent inability to identify a precipitating factor, management consists largely of symptomatic control. Treatment with topical corticosteroids may reduce inflammation and prevent adhesion formation and visual loss."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the connective tissue layer that covers the eyeball and inner layer of the eyelid. It is one of the most common causes of an uncomfortable red eye in clinical practice. Conjunctivitis is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion, made in instances of red eye and discharge where there is neither visual loss nor evidence of glaucoma, iritis or keratitis. It is typically bilateral, but the recent family history with discharge from the eye suggests an infective cause in the patient described by the scenario. It is also worth remembering that conjunctivitis may be viral (which is generally self-limiting) or bacterial in nature. Bacterial conjunctivitis is treated according to clinical severity. Classical therapy consists of instilling chloramphenicol eye drops to the affected eye; initially hourly for the first 24 hours, gradually decreasing the frequency to four times per day. General advice on hygienic measures may also be appropriate."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "When reactivation of dormant varicella zoster virus (herpes zoster/ shingles) affects the nasociliary division of the trigeminal nerve, herpetic eruptions can occur on the nose tip. The presence of these lesions is highly suggestive of present or imminent corneal involvement by the viral process (also known as Hutchinson's sign/rule). Ophthalmic zoster (herpes zoster ophthalmicus) can cause multiple ophthalmic conditions, including scleritis, iritis, corneal ulceration (which can be detected by fluorescein staining) and, in severe cases, blindness. Patients with corneal ulceration should be referred on to specialist care as there is a high risk of visual loss. Treatment is with acyclovir eye ointment and oral aciclovir (800 mg, five times daily) for 7–10 days. In cases of corneal ulceration, intensive treatment is started in the form of antibiotic eye drops whilst cycloplegic drops may additionally be used to relieve pain resulting from ciliary muscle spasm."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Acute closed angle glaucoma (or primary angle closure glaucoma) is an ophthalmic emergency that occurs when the iris is pressed against the trabecular meshwork at the angle of the anterior chamber of the eye, thereby blocking the outflow of aqueous humour. This blockage, and subsequent aqueous accumulation, precipitates a dangerous elevation of the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) which must be reduced to prevent optic nerve damage and preserve sight. In cases where it is not possible to immediately transfer the patient to a specialist unit for definitive surgical treatment, pilocarpine 4% (to constrict the pupil) and acetazolamide, as a stat dose of 500 mg IV followed by 500 mg orally, should be given. Mannitol 20% (500 mL) given by slow IV infusion is also proven to effectively reduce IOP. The pupil is usually constricted in iritis and an examination will confirm hypopyon. Intraocular pressure is not elevated in cases of conjunctivitis, episcleritis and keratitis."

The boy describes a headache and pain on moving his right eye. He has had multiple previous attacks of sinusitis. On examination, his temperature is 39.0°C, blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, pulse 94 beats/min, and respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Physical assessment reveals proptosis and ophthalmoplegia of the right eye with pain to gentle palpation. The sinuses are tender, his eyelids are erythematous and the conjunctiva is markedly injected, but visual acuity is intact bilaterally. A purulent nasal discharge is additionally noted by the examining clinician. What is the most appropriate next step?",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The scenario suggests a diagnosis of orbital cellulitis, a potentially blinding and life-threatening condition that must not be missed. It most commonly results from the spread of infection from the adjacent paranasal sinuses and is especially important to diagnose promptly in children, in whom it occurs more frequently than adults and can lead to rapid loss of sight. The typical triad suggestive of infection is that\n• The patient is unwell\n• There is tenderness over the sinuses\n• There is painful restriction of eye movements\nOwing to the seriousness of the condition, affected individuals should be admitted to hospital and given intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin or cephalosporin) unless cultures identify a causative agent for which specific treatment can be administered. The duration of intravenous therapy is dependent on the clinical course but typically lasts 1–2 weeks. Once the condition settles, intravenous antibiotics are replaced with oral antibiotics for a further 2 weeks at which point the patient is usually reviewed in the outpatient clinic. Topical steroid application and needle aspiration is not indicated in this scenario, although formal surgical drainage may be necessary in the presence of an orbital abscess refractory to intravenous therapy."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The features indicative of Horner's syndrome include ptosis or drooping of the eyelid, a small reactive pupil and the absence of sweating on the same side of the face. Horner's syndrome is caused by damage to the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye, in this case most likely due to a Pancoast/apical lung tumour. Ptosis can also be caused by general muscular disorders such as dystrophia myotonica and myasthenia gravis, but these are less likely in the absence of typical facies and without wider abnormalities of muscular tone. Third nerve palsy may present with ptosis, but the pupil is usually dilated and the affected eye may assume the classic ‘down and out' position."

            "explanation": "Lacerations to the eyelids generally need specialist attention, especially if\n• The lid margins are torn – as accurate approximation is important\n• Lacrimal ducts have been damaged\n• There is suspicion of a foreign body or penetrating eyelid injury\nIt may be necessary to use local anaesthesia to assess the eye and fluorescein is required to exclude an abrasion. Foreign bodies should be removed and visual acuity should always be tested to establish a baseline of function. However, normal visual acuity does not rule out the possibility of serious ophthalmic injury."

            "explanation": "Orbital 'blow out' fracture should be suspected following blunt ocular injury when the patient has diplopia, a recessed eye, defective eye movements, ipsilateral epistaxis and diminished sensation over the distribution of the infra-orbital nerve. Any disturbance in visual acuity following blunt ocular trauma should prompt early specialist referral. Pupillary abnormalities are common and can mask a dilated pupil caused by acute extradural haemorrhage; a high index of suspicion is therefore required. Third nerve palsy presents with ophthalmoplegia, ptosis and pupillary dilatation, however the history in this scenario is more consistent with a bony orbital injury."

The retinal artery may become blocked due to atherosclerosis, thrombosis or emboli. Episodes may occur in conjunction with transient ischaemic attacks. Carotid arterial duplex will identify flow abnormalities and/or the source of an embolus. Risk factors for arterial disease should be treated and the patient prescribed aspirin or clopidogrel.

A pansystolic murmur is more likely to be due to mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, but may also be caused by an atrial or ventricular septal defect which may allow emboli to cross from the right heart to the left. So-called paradoxical emboli are, however, a rare cause of TIA. Papilloedema is seen in cases of raised intracranial pressure. Occlusion of the posterior ciliary arteries may lead to ischaemia of the optic nerve head (ischaemic optic neuropathy) but this should not be mistaken for papilloedema. Retinal ‘flame haemorrhages' are seen in cases of venous occlusion."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "The scenario suggests the presence of a pituitary tumour impinging on the optic chiasm. Other causes for bitemporal hemianopia include nasopharyngeal carcinoma and sphenoid sinus mucocele. If a pituitary tumour is suspected, further assessment with an MRI and occasionally a CT scan (to detect calcification secondary to tumour growth) is indicated. Fundoscopy cannot be considered a valid answer here. Although fundoscopy may help identify disc atrophy, it does not constitute a diagnostic investigation in this case."

This area is especially tender when she touches it or combs her hair. She describes suffering a similar series of symptoms approximately a year before the present admission on the left side, which resulted in complete blindness in her left eye.

            "explanation": "This patient has giant cell (temporal) arteritis. Giant cell arteritis has several serious complications, most notably blindness, which may occur in 10%-15% of untreated or inadequately treated patients. Blindness may not be preceded by visual symptoms. High dosages of steroids (40–60 mg per day of prednisone) are used for giant cell arteritis. Clinical suspicion should guide commencing steroid treatment, which should not be delayed whilst awaiting a formal tissue diagnosis. The ESR is almost always elevated, but should not delay treatment. Where the history is uncertain, temporal artery biopsy should be undertaken. Referral to an ophthalmologist can often be avoided."

            "explanation": "Reiter's syndrome is characterized by the triad of urethritis, arthritis of large joints and conjunctivitis. The most likely pathogen involved in the process is Chlamydia. It is important to include a detailed sexual history during initial assessment and urethral swabs should be taken during clinical work-up so as to culture the causative organism and treat the patient with appropriate pharmacological agents. Eye involvement occurs in about 50% of men with urogenital reactive arthritis. Conjunctivitis and uveitis can present as redness of the eyes, eye pain and irritation, or blurred vision. Eye involvement typically occurs early in the course of reactive arthritis, and symptoms come and go. Staphylococcus is more commonly cultured from ocular foreign bodies. E. coli and Proteus may be cultured from urinary specimens in patients with urinary tract infections."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Primary (chronic) open angle glaucoma is the commonest form of glaucoma and the third leading cause of blindness in the UK. It is caused by a gradual resistance to the outflow of aqueous humour through the trabecular network. There is an increased risk as a result of advancing age, diabetes, being a first-degree relative of sufferers, African Caribbean ethnicity and myopia. Symptoms may be absent despite ongoing gradual increases in intraocular pressure. Central visual fields are spared until quite late on in the disease process. The condition is treated with ẞ-blockers such as timolol to reduce secretion of aqueous, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) which also reduce aqueous secretion and pilocarpine (para-sympathomimetic agent) to constrict the pupil and increase the outflow of aqueous. If these measures fail patients often require laser trabeculoplasty – a procedure that applies laser energy to regions around the trabecular network to improve drainage."
