            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Cerebral autoregulation is compromised in significant TBI, and this adds to the difficulty of achieving satisfactory perfusion in the context of raised ICP. However, injured brain can exhibit deranged autoregulation without raised ICP, for example, after decompressive craniectomy.\nCerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is directly related to ICP according to the relationship CPP = Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) – ICP.\nHeadache, vomiting and reduced consciousness level are cardinal indicators of raised ICP.\nDisplacement of venous blood and CSF resulting from small rises in ICP acts to limit the rise in pressure during the Monro-Kellie doctrine's compensatory phase. Herniation of the cingulate gyrus under the falx, of the uncus of the temporal lobe under the tentorium and of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum, can occur as this compensation fails."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Cervical spine injury cannot be excluded as part of the primary survey in a patient with reduced consciousness level (severe TBI implies a GCS of 8 or less at resuscitation). Cervical spine x-rays traditionally form part of the primary survey, but generally a CT trauma series incorporating head, neck and chest/abdomen/pelvis is likely to be most appropriate, depending on mechanism. Since there is a risk of ligamentous injury even where the CT is normal, cervical spine precautions are often maintained as far as possible pending clinical clearance of the neck.\nThe ATLS primary survey comprises airway management with cervical spine control, attention to breathing and circulation and a brief neurological assessment including GCS, pupil reactivity and blood glucose measurement (to exclude a possible contribution to conscious impairment)."

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Minimising secondary brain injury depends on achieving satisfactory cerebral perfusion.\nVentilatory parameters, adequate sedation and avoidance of hyponatraemia are each important in limiting rises in ICP that lead to compromised perfusion. Sedation of head-injured patients prevents assessment of the GCS and focal neurological function, but it remains possible to assess the pupils. The collar can be loosened with care during transit to prevent venous obstruction.\nU.K. trauma and audit research network guidelines point to a better prognosis for patients with severe TBI who are treated in a neurosurgical centre. Primary brain injury refers to the damage caused to the brain at impact – the goal of early transfer is access to specialist management to minimise secondary brain injury. Anaesthetic assessment of head-injured patients prior to transfer is generally recommended, but for conscious patients without significant intracranial bleeding or mass effect, a nurse escort may be sufficient."

            "explanation": "1. D Acute subdural haemorrhage\nAcute subdural haematoma (ASDH) is typical of high-energy trauma in the young, and the patient may also have significant primary brain injury. The subdural blood encounters little resistance in dissecting dura from arachnoid, so spreads diffusely over the brain surface without regard to suture lines (Figure 25.1). Craniotomy and evacuation are the mainstay of management.\n2. A Chronic subdural haemorrhage\nChronic subdural haematoma (Figure 25.2) without a history of trauma is common in those with deranged clotting. The presentation is typically insidious and, after correcting the clotting, evacuation through burr holes under local anaesthetic will often be a satisfactory approach.\n3. B Diffuse axonal injury\nDiffuse axonal injury is a post-mortem diagnosis implying shearing of axons due to rapid acceleration of the brain. However, foci of petechial haemorrhage in deep brain structures in a patient comatose from the moment of high- energy impact are strongly suggestive.\n4. C Extradural haemorrhage\nThe classic presentation of extradural haematoma involves transient loss of consciousness, followed by recovery to normal (the lucid interval), then rapid deterioration to coma. More commonly, extradural haematoma can complicate a moderate or severe primary head injury as discussed in the context of ASDH previously, especially where a temporal bone fracture is associated with rupture of the underlying middle meningeal artery (Figure 25.3). Management entails immediate craniotomy and clot evacuation.\n5. E Traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage\nTraumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage (Figure 25.4) is the result of venous bleeding into the subarachnoid space, rather than the arterial haemorrhage of aneurysmal SAH, and is not associated with significant vasospasm."

            "explanation": "1. E Arteriovenous malformation rupture\nAlthough AVM as a cause of ICH is relatively rare compared to ICH, it has important investigation and treatment implications and the possibility of underlying AVM is a major concern in the event of attempted clot evacuation. A young patient with an ICH outside the locations typical for hypertensive bleed (e.g., basal ganglia, cerebellum) will certainly require investigation for possible AVM.\n2. A Berry aneurysm rupture\nThird nerve palsy associated with thunderclap headache classically represents rupture of an aneurysm compressing the posterior communicating artery. CT scan performed early is highly sensitive for SAH, but where there is a strong history and no evidence of blood, delayed lumbar puncture is indicated, with samples sent for cell count and assay for levels of the haemoglobin breakdown products oxyhaemoglobin and bilirubin, whose presence suggest prior haemorrhage. Confirmed subarachnoid haemorrhage is generally investigated with catheter angiography, and an underlying ruptured aneurysm can be managed surgically ('clipping') or by radiological embolisation ('coiling').\n3. C Dural AV fistula rupture\nPulsatile tinnitus is pathonomic of dural arteriovenous fistula. Rupture of these lesions can manifest with subdural, subarachnoid, or intracerebral haemorrhage.\n4. B Hypertensive intracerebral haemorrhage\nHaemorrhagic stroke is common, particularly in undiagnosed and uncontrolled hypertensives. The basal ganglia are a typical site for these bleeds. Surgery may be considered to relieve mass effect, but management is generally medical. In younger patients and those with an atypical appearance, further imaging to rule out an underlying neoplasia or vascular malformation may be indicated.\n5. D Pituitary apoplexy\nPituitary apoplexy refers to the syndrome associated with acute haemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland (see Chapter 43). Headache, visual loss, ophthalmoplegia and variable consciousness impairment are typical. Endocrine resuscitation is the first management priority."

            "explanation": "In each case, diagnosis and management should be discussed promptly with a neurointensivist or endocrinologist.\n1. D Cerebral salt wasting\nHyponatraemia after a brain insult should prompt consideration of cerebral salt wasting and syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). Each involves inappropriate excretion of a concentrated urine due to failure of normal pituitary control. Cerebral salt wasting leads to volume depletion, requiring prompt replacement.\n2. B Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion\nBy contrast, patients suffering SIADH are clinically euvolaemic or even somewhat overfilled, because of free water retention as a result of inappropriately high ADH levels. In this case, sodium replacement and occasionally blockade of ADH activity, using demeclocycline for instance, is usually appropriate. Fluid restriction is also used but may be dangerous in the context of compromised perfusion due to raised ICP (head injury) or vasospasm (subarachnoid haemorrhage).\n3. A Diabetes Insipidus\nExcretion of large volumes of dilute urine resulting in hypernatraemia is another frequent complication of head injury, and reflects failure of the pituitary to secrete ADH. Administration of boluses of desmopressin/DDAVP may be used to manage this.\n4. C Panhypopituitarism\nGeneralised pituitary dysfunction is a common sequel of TBI. It should be actively excluded in recovering patients, especially where progress is slow, by means of a pituitary function screen (9 am cortisol, free T3 and T4, oestradiol or testosterone, prolactin, IGF-1).\n5. E Post-concussive syndrome\nPost-concussive syndrome is a poorly defined constellation of symptoms that can interfere significantly with recovery. A head-injury rehabilitation specialist team is best placed to advise on managing these problems."
