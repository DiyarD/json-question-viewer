She now presents with weakness, weight gain, delayed ankle reflexes, and scaly skin. Her serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level is high. Which intervention should be considered?",

            "explanation": "- Iodine-131 (131I) treatment for Graves disease often leads to hypothyroidism.\n- Hypothyroidism typically presents with weakness, weight gain, delayed ankle reflexes, and scaly skin.\n- Diagnosis is usually confirmed by checking a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level; a high TSH level with symptoms of hypothyroidism while on levothyroxine is sufficient for diagnosis.\n- The treatment for hypothyroidism is to increase the levothyroxine dose.\n- Thiazide is not known to cause or mimic hypothyroidism.\n- Serum thyroglobulin is used to monitor thyroid cancer patients, not for diagnosing hypothyroidism."

            "explanation": "- Papillary thyroid cancer is indolent with an excellent prognosis, and surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment.\n- Until 2016, American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommended total or near-total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer tumors larger than 1 cm, and lobectomy for tumors less than 1 cm.\n- Studies published before 2016 questioned tumor size as an absolute indicator for total thyroidectomy, given its higher risks (hypoparathyroidism, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury).\n- More recent data failed to demonstrate a survival advantage of total thyroidectomy for tumors 1.0 to 4.0 cm.\n- The 2016 ATA guidelines suggested that thyroid lobectomy is adequate treatment for unifocal, intrathyroid papillary thyroid cancer tumors up to 4 cm, in the absence of prior head and neck radiation, familial thyroid cancer, or clinically detectable cervical nodal metastasis.\n- Total thyroidectomy may be chosen if adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment is planned, if high-risk features are present, or based on patient preference.\n- Prophylactic lymph node dissection is not indicated for noninvasive, clinically node-negative papillary thyroid cancer tumors smaller than 4.0 cm."

            "explanation": "- Hypercalcemia affects up to 30% of patients with metastatic cancer, mimicking underlying malignancy symptoms.\n- Acute and symptomatic hypercalcemia require prompt therapy to restore glomerular filtration rate and normalize serum calcium levels.\n- Initial therapy should begin with intravenous volume expansion with 0.9% saline.\n- Intravenous bisphosphonates are the initial treatment of choice as they inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption, but they do not reach maximum effectiveness until days 2 through 4.\n- For rapid reduction in serum calcium levels, calcitonin should be added to the immediate treatment regimen, as its beneficial effects are seen as soon as 6 hours after administration.\n- Loop diuretics may be added cautiously if the patient has signs of fluid overload, but they can worsen electrolyte derangements and volume depletion.\n- Glucocorticoids are only beneficial in lymphomas secreting calcitriol.\n- Cinacalcet is ineffective in malignant hypercalcemia where PTH levels are typically suppressed.\n- Mithramycin is no longer used for acute malignant hypercalcemia due to less effectiveness and convenience compared to bisphosphonates."

Lesions less than 4 cm with 10 HU or fewer are unlikely to be malignant, so further imaging like MRI is not needed for malignancy assessment at this stage.\n- MIBG scanning was formerly used for pheochromocytoma localization but has been replaced by MRI and PET scan.\n- Adrenal biopsy has a very limited role and cannot differentiate benign from malignant tumors.\n- Given the need to evaluate functional status, and normal metanephrines, a dexamethasone suppression test is the appropriate next step."
