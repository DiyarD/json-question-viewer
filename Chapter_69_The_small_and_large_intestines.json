            "explanation": "The jejunum is regarded as constituting two-fifths (40%) of the small bowel length. It is the distribution of the arterial supply that distinguishes the jejunum from the ileum. The jejunal arterial branches join each other in a series of anastomosing loops to form arterial arcades, which are single in the upper jejunum and double in the lower jejunum. From these arcades long straight arteries pass into the mesenteric border of the jejunum, producing narrow windows between the branches.\nIn the ileum the arcades are more numerous (three to five) and lie nearer to the ileal wall so that the straight arteries from the arcades are much shorter before they enter the mesenteric border of the ileum. Therefore, the windows between the arteries are broader. Another distinguishing feature is that the ileal mesentery contains much more fat. Autonomic nerves from the splanchnic nerves accompany the blood vessels. The parasympathetic augments peristaltic activity and secretion while the sympathetic inhibits and is vasoconstrictor.\nPeyer's patches are aggregated lymphoid follicles concentrated in the ileum. These are sometimes visible through the muscle wall of the ileum as whitish plaques in the mucus membrane. When enlarged they form the lead point in childhood ileocaecal intussusception."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The sigmoid colon is completely invested in peritoneum and hangs free on a mesentery called the sigmoid mesocolon. Within the layers of this mesocolon travel the blood vessels and accompanying lymphatics. In resection of the sigmoid colon, the mesocolon has to be dissected with meticulous care to excise all the lymph nodes in cancer surgery.\nThe taenia coli, three in number, are flat bands of longitudinal muscle that extend from the base of the appendix to the rectosigmoid junction. They pull the colon to cause the haustrations. On both sides, the ascending colon on the right and descending colon on the left are very closely related to the ureters. This fact is of the utmost importance during colonic resections to identify the ureters and prevent iatrogenic damage.\nThe superior mesenteric artery, the artery of the midgut, supplies the large bowel until the junction of the right two-thirds and left one-third of the transverse colon. At this site is the anastomosis between the branches of the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries (artery of the hindgut) so that there is a complete arterial supply of the entire colon along its margin referred to as 'the marginal artery of Drummond'."

            ],
            "explanation": "The main function of the small intestine is the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients and fluid. Carbohydrates and proteins are broken down by pancreatic enzymes and absorbed through the brush border by movements of the villi (by the ‘villus pump') aided by smooth muscle contraction. Movements of the villi are regulated by Meissner's plexus of nerves stimulated by the intestinal hormones. The jejunum is the main site for absorption of water, amino acids, sugars, short chain fatty acids, vitamins, minerals and glycerol. The terminal ileum is the principal site of absorption bile salts and vitamin B12, the site being referred to as the entero-hepatic circulation.\nShould a part of the jejunum be removed, the ileum will take on its function, but resection of the terminal ileum as in a right hemicolectomy or disease as in regional ileitis, will result in disturbance of the entero-hepatic circulation causing reduced bile acid pool with a greater chance of developing gallstones and deficiency of B12, and vitamins A, D and K. The small intestine is the site of synthesis of plasma lipoproteins.\nMovements of the muscular coats of the small bowel is controlled by Auerbach's plexus of nerves. These two plexuses of nerves are referred to as the enteric nervous system, which controls the various intestinal hormones, abnormal secretions of which result in neuro-endocrine tumours.\nThe principal colonic function is to absorb water; 1 litre of ileal contents enter the caecum every 24 hours to be converted into 150 to 250 mL of faeces. The normal colonic microflora (e.g., bacteroides) cause fermentation of dietary fibre leading to the formation of short-chain fatty acids, an important metabolic fuel for the colonic mucosa. Normally faecal residue reaches the caecum 4 hours, and the rectum 24 hours, after a meal."

            "explanation": "In 95% of cases the disease starts in the rectum and spreads proximally as a continuous process. If the disease does not conform to this pattern, the diagnosis of UC should be in doubt. While most patients present electively, 5% to 10% present as an emergency with acute fulminating disease. The inflammation is diffuse and continuous, being confined to the mucosa and superficial submucosa. One of the complications is toxic megacolon, which typically affects the transverse colon. If on a plain x-ray the diameter is >6 cm toxic colon should be diagnosed.\nThe disease does not affect all the layers of the bowel. If it does so, the diagnosis is not UC. Microscopically granulomas are not a feature. They occur in Crohn's disease and tuberculosis, in the latter they are caseating. Crypt abscesses are seen on histology, the walls of the crypts of Lieberkuhn being infiltrated by inflammatory cells which re also seen in the lamina propria."

            "explanation": "Internal fistulae is not a complication of UC. This is because the disease process is confined to the mucosa and submucosa. Fistula tend to occur when the pathology is a transmural inflammation as in Crohn's disease. The complications in UC are carcinoma when the disease is present for longer than 10 years; primary sclerosing cholangitis is an extraintestinal manifestation that might lead to cirrhosis and liver failure while cholangiocarcinoma might rarely occur. Ankylosing spondylitis is 20 times more common in UC than in the general population. Large-bowel perforation is a very serious complication with a mortality of 40%. The complications of ulcerative colitis are enumerated in Tables 69.1 and 69.2."

            "explanation": "In UC the barium enema findings are lack of haustrations and a narrow contracted colon, which are the result of fibrosis (Figure 69.1a). For the same reason, in long-standing disease, the rectosigmoid is pulled forward away from the sacrum thus creating an increase in the presacral or retro-rectal space (Figure 69.1b). Backwash ileitis is another prominent radiological feature that can be confirmed on colonoscopy. Cobblestone appearance is not a feature seen in UC."

            "explanation": "Colonoscopy has a vital role in the management of UC. Once suspected, colonoscopy is carried out to see the extent of the disease and confirm the diagnosis by taking biopsies at various levels. Macroscopically the presence of continuous disease and absence of 'skip lesions' (normal bowel between diseased bowel) will set it apart from Crohn's colitis. The procedure is also useful as a follow up to monitor response to medical treatment. Patients who have had the disease for >10 years have an increased chance of developing cancer. So such patients should undergo annual colonoscopic surveillance and biopsies to exclude dysplasia or cancer. It should not be done in the acute stage for fear of causing a perforation."

Those who have had the disease since childhood, had a severe first attack and in whom the entire colon is involved (pancolitis) have an enhanced risk for carcinoma. Therefore patients with pancolitis of >10 years are entered into annual colonoscopic surveillance. The value of such screening programmes is questioned because most UC patients who develop cancer (3.5%) present between attendances for colonoscopic screening. Colonoscopic screening is a routine when multiple biopsies are taken to detect dysplasia, which can occur in a flat mucosa or in dysplasia-associated lesions or mass (DALMs)."

Full supportive treatment is instituted in the form of intravenous fluids and alimentation, intravenous hydrocortisone and steroid enemas or suppositories. If improvement does not occur within 3–5 days, surgery should be undertaken. This should be a team decision between the surgeon and gastroenterologist to ensure that surgery is undertaken at the optimum time.

            "explanation": "Prior to considering a pouch procedure, the patient's anal sphincter must be normal. Some surgeons establish this by doing a rectal examination and asking the patient to tighten the anal sphincter, whilst others might do sphincter pressure studies and anal manometry. Once a pouch procedure is carried out, 15% of patients have the pouch removed for poor pouch function. Overall 50% of patients with ileoanal pouch have a very good quality of life, while 35% are less satisfied but keep their pouch.\nSmall-bowel obstruction as a postoperative complication occurs in about 10%–15%, while pouchitis occurs in about 30%. Pouchitis is inflammation of the pouch, which might result in increased frequency, tenesmus, bleeding, purulent discharge, malaise and fever with raised inflammatory markers. It responds to metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. Sometimes the condition might be asymptomatic.\nA pouch procedure should not be done in any case of inflammatory bowel disease. It must be done only in ulcerative colitis. However, there is an entity called indeterminate colitis where after much deliberation a pouch procedure might be offered but only after warning the patient of the failure rate of 25%–30%."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Crohn's disease is not a curable disease, let alone by resectional surgery. It can recur in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract even after removal of a diseased section of the bowel. Hence resection for CD must always be conservative, and as little bowel as possible should be sacrificed.\nWhile CD affects any part of the gastrointestinal tract, the ileum is most commonly affected, which is in 60%, sometimes along with the right colon. Hence, when it was described by Crohn, Ginzburg and Oppenheimer in 1932, they called the disease ‘Regional Ileitis'. The large bowel alone is involved in almost one-third, while in 5% the stomach and duodenum is site of the disease. Perianal disease is present in 50%–75% of sufferers. Patients with small-bowel disease have perianal involvement in 25%, whilst three-quarters of those with large bowel Crohn's have perianal disease.\nThe condition affects the entire thickness of the bowel in the form of transmural inflammation. Although non-caseating giant cell granulomas are regarded as the hallmark of the disease, they are found in only 60% of patients and most common in anorectal involvement. Amongst the sufferers 1 in 10 patients have a first-degree relative with the disease."

Internal fistulae are a common complication due to the transmural inflammation, involving all layers of the bowel wall, causing the diseased bowel to penetrate into neighbouring structures – skin, urinary bladder, colon, small bowel and vagina. Macroscopically, the diseased bowel shows serpiginous (snake-like) deep mucosal and aphthous ulcers; mucosal oedema between the ulcers gives the classical ‘cobblestone' appearance.

When perforation occurs, after optimum resuscitation, the bowel containing the perforation is resected with end-to-end anastomosis removing as little bowel as possible. On opening a patient with acute intestinal obstruction from structuring, after thorough optimisation, localised resection and end-to-end anastomosis is the treatment."

Moreover, the ileum to be used for a pouch might be involved with the disease. Perianal disease, which is common in colonic CD, is another reason for this operation being unsuitable.\nStrictureplasty, whereby a longitudinal incision is made and closed transversely (similar to the Heineke-Mikulicz pyloroplasty), is suitable for short strictures. In long strictures not suitable for the usual type of strictureplasty and where bowel preservation is vital, some surgeons have opted for a 'Finney's type' of strictureplasty. In very severe and extensive disease, proctocolectomy and ileostomy is the procedure of choice; when the rectum is free of disease, colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis can be done. In the vast majority, however, segmental resections of diseased bowel is the procedure most often carried out."

In UC, in emergency situations such as toxic megacolon or perforation, a total abdominal colectomy and ileostomy is performed, avoiding a pelvic dissection. The rectal stump is brought out as a mucous fistula or closed as a Hartmann's procedure.\nAll patients with IBD must be under the joint care of the gastroenterologist and surgeon. In the elective situation, all patients must be given a very good trial of medical treatment before embarking upon surgery.

It causes diarrhoea and acute abdominal pain; severe cases might be confused with UC. It is not easy to grow in stool culture. Treatment is supportive, the condition being notifiable. Actinomycosis is a rare infection caused by Actinomycosis israeli. It develops several weeks after removal of a perforated acute appendicitis. It results in an abscess that spreads across tissue planes from the retroperitoneum to the overlying skin forming a woody indurated mass that discharges thin, watery odourless material, which becomes thick and malodorous. The discharge grows sulphur granules. Treatment is long-term penicillin or cotrimoxazole in high doses.\nAfter the development of AIDS with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, there might be opportunistic intestinal infection caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa and fungi. Treatment is medical specifically against the organism. Clostridium difficile is a cause of nosocomial infection. It is caused by a Gram-positive bacillus that produces a toxin. It is a cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and pseudomembranous colitis. The patient might be very ill with fever, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Besides full supportive care, the patient is treated by vancomycin or metronidazole. In extreme cases emergency subtotal colectomy and ileostomy might be necessary.\nAmoebiasis, typhoid and tuberculosis are discussed in Chapter 6: ‘Surgery in the tropics'."

At operation no acute inflammation is found; instead a solid yellowish tumour is found usually in the distal appendix. Appendicectomy is the treatment. However, if the tumour occupies the base of the appendix or invades the caecum, a right hemicolectomy has to be done.\nThe cause of this syndrome is the excessive secretion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). These tumours arise from the gastro-entero-pancreatic part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Therefore this tumour is a part of the family of neuroendocrine tumours (NET). They arise from the ileum and rectum, the former being more common. They have a propensity to metastasise to the liver long after removal of the primary. It is the liver secondaries that produce the syndrome by secreting serotonin. They have a common embryological origin and cyto-chemical features which are a high amine (A) content, capacity for amine precursor uptake (APU) and the property of decarboxylation (D), hence the acronym for the tumour APUDOMA.\nThe clinical manifestations are protean in nature. The syndrome usually occurs in relation to malignant tumours that have metastasized, usually to the liver. The features are the following:\nVasomotor: Flushing in face and neck and sun-exposed areas; bronchial tumours can cause widespread flushes with devastating severity\nGastrointestinal: Mild to explosive diarrhoea with its effects, abdominal pain, bloating, tenesmus\nCardiopulmonary: Hypotension during flushing attacks, right-sided heart failure, pulmonary and tricuspid stenosis (not mitral stenosis), bronchospasm\nNutritional: Weight loss, features of pellagra: dementia and skin lesions from niacin deficiency"

            "explanation": "In FAP more than 80% have a positive family history. The remaining 20% are the result of new mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. For families there should be a screening policy in place. Genetic testing should be offered in the early teens; from teenage years, annual colonoscopy should be carried out; those who get the disease would do so by the age of 20 years; those clear at the age of 20 should be offered 5-year colonoscopic surveillance until 50 years of age.\nThose with the disease should be offered surgical treatment. Of the surgical options available, restorative proctocolectomy with an ileo-anal pouch is one of the choices offered. Although this removes the whole colon and rectum, in a stapled anastomosis, the small strip of rectal mucosa between the pouch and dentate line has a chance of developing cancer. Therefore some surgeons perform a complete mucosectomy of the rectal cuff; the price paid by the patient for such an immunity against cancer is a worse functional result.\nHNPCC is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a mutation in one of the DNA mismatch repair genes, MLH1 and MSH2. There is an 80% lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer which is diagnosed at 45 years whilst females have an almost 50% risk of developing endometrial cancer. Genetic testing or the Amsterdam II criteria helps in diagnosing HNPCC. FAP is inherited as an autosomal dominant gene (not recessive gene).\nBoth sexes are equally affected and either might transmit the disease; only those with the disease can transmit the condition and half the children are likely to inherit."

            "explanation": "The distribution of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is the same, 70% of them being left-sided. Sporadic adenomas are identical to those of FAP. Left untreated, cancer is inevitable, with a 100% chance of adenomas in FAP turning malignant. The larger the adenoma, the greater is the chance of it showing dysplasia; when dysplasia occurs in them, it is of a higher grade.\nThere is a fall in the incidence of colorectal carcinoma where screening programmes have colonoscopy and polypectomy as an integral part. In two-thirds of colonic adenomas and carcinomas, there is mutation of the APC gene, a process that develops early in the pathway to carcinogenesis. K-ras mutations, more common in larger lesions is associated with a poor prognosis. Mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene causes the transition from the adenoma to carcinoma signalling invasion. Knowledge of certain mutations can be used to assess prognosis and target adjuvant treatment."

            "explanation": "The most common site (60%) of colorectal cancer is the rectosigmoid region. This is thought to be due to the prolonged contact of the faeces with the mucosa in that region. It therefore follows that the majority will be within reach of the rigid sigmoidoscope so that a biopsy can be obtained in the outpatient department. At the time of diagnosis, one-third of the patients will have liver secondaries. Clinically patients might present either as electively or as an emergency; 20% of patients present as an emergency with intestinal obstruction or peritonitis, the cause of which is perforation. Emergency presentation is associated with a worse prognosis. Reduced dietary fibre is well known as a factor in the aetiology of large bowel cancer. Increased fibre in the diet causes large amount of roughage, which helps to reduce the transit time thus diminishing the exposure of mucosa to dietary carcinogens."

            "explanation": "Intravenous urography is not a routine investigation for colorectal cancer. It is done when an US or CT shows hydronephrosis to see the function of the opposite kidney. In a patient known to have a solitary kidney, IVU is done to assess renal function. The elective clinical presentation for right and left colonic carcinomas differs. Right-sided cancers present with features of iron deficiency anaemia such as malaise or undue shortness of breath while carrying out normal daily activities due to anaemic hypoxia from microscopic bleeding; this is shown by positive faecal occult blood. Left-sided carcinomas present with altered bowel habit in the form of increasing constipation and need to use laxatives; this is because the faeces in the left colon is more formed. Rectal bleeding is another feature.\nColonoscopy is the method to confirm the diagnosis by taking a biopsy. It is also useful to exclude a synchronous carcinoma, which is present in 5% or an adenoma (Figure 69.5), the latter being found in one-third of specimens resected for colonic cancer.

This should detect 70% of large bowel cancers. Once the diagnosis is made on colonoscopy, thorough assessment with regard to local and regional staging by spiral CECT and US is carried out.\nIf staging detects liver secondaries, the case is discussed in a MDT meeting as to the best way forward and considering treating the secondaries as a staged procedure. Those patients who present as acute intestinal obstruction should be considered for a staged procedure, of which there are choices. A left colonic carcinoma causing acute closed-loop obstruction could have a stent inserted, which will get over the acute emergency. The patient can then be resuscitated and staged and then have a one-stage resection and anastomosis without a temporary stoma.\nIf staging shows liver secondaries, resection of the large bowel is carried out by the appropriate hemicolectomy as there is no better palliation than removal of the original cancer. Liver secondaries are never biopsied for fear of causing dissemination of the growth and bleeding."

Preoperative chemotherapy has no role at present, although it is used in a selected group postoperatively.\nAfter resection for hepatic metastases the 5-year survival is 30%.

Because of the dietary habits, in the Western World 75% of the population of 70-year-olds has diverticular disease of the colon. A low-residue diet (consumed in the West) results in excessive segmentation of the sigmoid colon causing increased intraluminal pressure.

Hypovolaemic shock of rapid onset associated with bloody diarrhoea is another feature.\nIschaemic colitis affects the left colon in the distribution of the inferior mesenteric artery with acute features similar to those affecting the SMA.

Most of these patients recover without any treatment, the underlying pathology in due course resulting in a stricture from fibrosis.\nAngiodysplasia, a vascular malformation, usually presents as an emergency with haemorrhage, occurring in the ascending colon and caecum not the sigmoid colon."

            "explanation": "A loop transverse colostomy is no longer regarded as the ideal method to defunction an anterior resection; a loop ileostomy has replaced the procedure because of the following:\n(1) A loop ileostomy is formed in the right iliac fossa and hence the patient finds it much easier to manage the bag; (2) Loop transverse colostomy has the potential to prolapse; (3) Proximity to the rib cage makes attachment of the bag in loop colostomy insecure; (4) Loop colostomy can sometimes compromise the blood supply to the distal anastomosis; and (5) Contents of a loop ileostomy are not malodorous. An end ileostomy is not always a permanent procedure. It is the stoma constructed in an emergency situation when a subtotal colectomy is done for acute toxic megacolon or perforation in UC or CD.\nA loop ileostomy is always a temporary procedure constructed in the right iliac fossa to defunction a low anterior resection or ileo-anal pouch procedure after total colectomy for UC or FAP. Before closing it, a contrast study is always carried out to make sure that the distal anastomosis is securely intact. An end colostomy in the left iliac fossa can be permanent as after an abdomino-perineal resection for low rectal cancer or temporary as in a Hartmann's operation. To know clinically if a stoma is permanent or temporary, the patient must be turned on the side to see if the anus is still present. If it is, the stoma is temporary. Stoma complications are common and often underestimated. This is because the patient tends to put up with the inconvenience as he or she ‘has had enough' and does not seek advice unless it is an emergency or making his or her life miserable."

The other causes are CD, radiation enteritis and abdominal trauma. In the management, attention to nutrition is vital as the patient would be losing a large amount of intestinal fluid, the amount depending upon whether it is a high-output or low-output fistula. Arbitrarily, 500 mL of daily lost fluid is regarded as the ‘cut-off point' – > than 500 mL/day is high-output fistula and <500 mL/day low out-put fistula.\nThe higher the fistula, the greater will be the loss of fluid and hence the paramount need for attention to detail regarding nutrition. Although the ideal route for nutrition is enteral, in a high-output fistula this might not be possible; hence parenteral nutrition should be instituted. When a fistula does not close spontaneously, it indicates epithelial continuity between gut and skin or underlying pathology such as an obstructing carcinoma, CD, or abscess."

            "explanation": "When resection is indicated in Crohn's colitis, laparoscopic approach is not particularly suitable for the less experienced because transmural inflammation causes the mesentery to be foreshortened and colonic disease is usually more severe. In general, benign conditions are difficult to deal with laparoscopically. However, experienced laparoscopic colorectal surgeons might consider an initial laparoscopic attempt provided there is a safe conversion threshold.\nLymph node retrieval is the same as those performed by the traditional method although the operative times are longer. In laparoscopic surgery, as the ability to palpate the lesion is not possible, tattooing the lesion at preoperative colonoscopic assessment is used according to the unit's policy; this is usually advocated as a standardised approach. Unlike in open surgery, the initial dissection is commenced medially by taking the major vascular pedicles thus freeing the mesocolon and then dividing the lateral peritoneal reflection as the lateral attachments provide retraction during early dissection."

When an older patient presents with suspected features of acute appendicitis and preoperatively is found to be anaemic, the diagnosis is almost certainly a caecal carcinoma as genuine acute appendicitis does not cause anaemia.\nIn the elective situation, the presentation is from features of iron deficiency anaemia due to chronic occult bleeding or pain and lump over the right side of the abdomen. Sometimes, patients present with symptoms due to metastatic disease. This can be in the form of jaundice due to liver secondaries. A barium enema would show an irregular filling defect in the caecum (Figures 69.8a and b).\nThe management in the emergency situation is resuscitation and stabilisation of the patient. Electively, ideally haemoglobin close to 9 g/dL is aimed for, followed by confirmation of the diagnosis by colonoscopy and biopsy. The histology will show adenocarcinoma. This is followed by staging CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and also carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), the latter being useful in surveillance if it is elevated initially.\nDefinitive treatment is radical right hemicolectomy, which can nowadays be performed using a laparoscopic approach depending upon the choice of the surgical team.\nPostoperatively if the growth is Dukes' C stage the patient is given adjuvant chemotherapy."

            "explanation": "Crohn's disease was first brought to light in 1932 by Crohn, Ginzburg and Oppenheimer, from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who called it ‘Regional ileitis'. However, it was TK Dalziell, a surgeon from Glasgow, who in 1913 described the same disease, which he called 'Chronic interstitial enteritis' and likened the macroscopic appearance of the small bowel to 'an eel in rigor mortis'.\nThe disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, is characterised by transmural inflammation that can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. It affects males and females equally and has a bimodal distribution with increased incidence in the twenties followed by further spike in the late sixties. The aetiology is multi-factorial, the possible causes being immunologic, infectious, genetic, and environmental.\nThe initial pathology is the formation of apthous and serpiginous ulcers with normal intervening mucosa that appear nodular and is referred to as cobblestone mucosa (Figure 69.13). Typical transmural inflammation can lead to perforation or internal fistulae or cause a stricture; there is overgrowth of fat beyond the mesentery covering the bowel wall (Figure 69.14) associated with regional lymphadenopathy. Diseased bowel is interspersed with normal unaffected bowel, an outcome referred to as skip lesions, which is typical of Crohn's disease. The pathology in CD is summarised in Table 69.8.\nThe most frequent site of Crohn's disease is the terminal ileum. This is followed by isolated colonic disease and then by isolated disease of the small bowel. Anal disease by itself is rare and usually accompanies colonic involvement.\nOn microscopy (Figure 69.3) the typical feature is non-caseating granuloma, which is present in about 60% of patients. The complications are local pertaining to the bowel (Table 69.6) and systemic or extra-intestinal (Table 69.7).\nCrohn's disease needs close collaboration between an aggressive physician and a conservative surgeon. The extent of the disease is established by a barium meal and follow-through showing a string sign of Kantor (Figure 69.15) or small bowel enema and colonoscopy and biopsy in large bowel disease. Other radiological findings are skip lesions, cobblestone mucosa, fistulae and spiculation (Figure 69.4). Treatment is mainly medical and should be tailored for the individual patient. Drugs used are steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acid derivatives (mainly for large bowel disease), antibiotics, immunosuppresives and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) antagonists such as infliximab and adalimumab.\nThe indication for surgery in Crohn's disease are shown in Tables 69.9 and 69.10 and the available surgical options in Tables 69.11 and 69.12.\nAnorectal Crohn's disease (Figure 69.2) Perianal CD occurs most often in association with large bowel involvement; it can, however, occur in isolation or in the presence of ileal disease.\nIn keeping with Crohn's disease in general, conservative approach is the first option. Perianal abscesses are drained. MRI of the pelvis is the 'gold standard' to distinguish between a high anal and a low anal fistula, a distinction that is mandatory, as the management is different. Whilst a low anal fistula can be treated by laying open, the high fistula requires the use of a seton and staged procedure to drain the sepsis and is the domain of an expert colorectal specialist."

            "explanation": "Patients present as an emergency with rectal bleeding with pain on the left side of the abdomen over the left colon. If the ischaemia results in complete disruption of the blood supply, infarction of the colon ensues. This manifests with full-blown peritonitis from a gangrenous colon. Elective patients present with episodes of rectal bleeding with pain in the left upper quadrant, symptoms that reflect ischaemia of the splenic flexure from atheromatous obstruction to the inferior mesenteric artery.\nOn examination there might be tenderness over the left side of the abdomen. Most of these patients are elderly and settle down with conservative management. In a more serious presentation there might be SIRS response in the form of hypotension, fever, oliguria and altered mental status. Patients who have settled down with conservative management might later present with features of a left colonic stricture, complaining of increasing constipation and intermittent colicky abdominal pain. This might require local resection and end-to-end anastomosis. The summary of presentations is shown in Figure 69.16. The various causes are shown in Figure 69.17.\nIn the elective situation colonoscopy is performed to look for mucosal ischaemia, which can be patchy. CT will show a thickened colon, while a barium enema (Figure 69.18) shows a narrowing of the colon confined to the distribution of the inferior mesenteric artery in the region of the splenic flexure with thumb-printing.\nIn the emergency presentation, initial treatment is conservative with active resuscitation in the form of bed rest, analgesia, antibiotics and appropriate treatment of hypovolaemia. The patient who presents with peritonitis from gangrenous colon needs optimisation followed by urgent laparotomy, resection of the infarcted bowel and exteriorisation as colostomy and mucus fistula. A laparostomy should be considered as these patients often have further ischaemia for which a second-look operation might be necessary."

On questioning patients might admit to constipation, which would point to pathology in the large bowel, most often diverticular disease. The other causes are carcinoma of the rectosigmoid and Crohn's colitis.\nManagement should be to confirm the diagnosis by various imaging techniques such as barium enema, which would show air (Figure 69.10) or barium (Figure 69.11) within the urinary bladder and CT scan also to confirm air in the bladder (Figure 69.12). This should be followed by colonoscopy (or flexible sigmoidoscopy, as diverticular stricture would preclude a full colonoscopy) and biopsy, most importantly to exclude the possibility of a carcinoma within a segment of sigmoid diverticulitis. Once carcinoma is excluded and diverticulitis is confirmed, sigmoid colectomy is carried out. At operation the inflamed colon is pinched off the vault of the urinary bladder and the hole in the bladder closed off with interrupted absorbable sutures; sigmoid colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis is performed.\nIn the case of colovesical fistula due to rectosigmoid cancer, operation is performed after confirmation of the diagnosis and staging the disease. The operation will involve en bloc resection of the sigmoid carcinoma in the form of high anterior resection with partial cystectomy. When the fistula is due to Crohn's disease, sigmoid colectomy is performed followed by removal of macroscopic disease from the bladder and the urinary bladder closed in two layers with catheter left in situ for 10 days."

            "explanation": "Patients with ulcerative colitis might present electively or as an emergency. The vast majority, about 95%, present electively. The usual sufferer is a female between 30 and 40 years who complains of loose stools with blood and mucus. Sometimes she has to rush to the toilet and might be caught short. Anything up to 4 to 6 trips to the lavatory per day leaves her constantly with a feeling of insufficient evacuation and tenesmus. Colicky left-sided abdominal pain usually accompanies the loose stools. On examination there is not much to find except for some left iliac fossa tenderness and blood and mucus on rectal examination. Sigmoidoscopy (rigid or flexible) in the outpatient shows evidence of proctitis – hyperaemic mucosa with purulent and mucoid exudate.\nDiagnosis is by clinical assessment followed by endoscopy and histological confirmation. At endoscopy (Figure 69.20), the mucosa appears reddened, oedematous and haemorrhagic; there might be tiny ulcerations. Mucosal friability with contact bleeding is a feature. Mucosal changes start in the rectum and proceed proximally to a varying extent. In left-sided colitis the proximal extent is up to the splenic flexure; when the inflammation extends proximal to this level, it is considered as extensive colitis; backwash ileitis is seen in about 10% of patients.\nBarium enema shows the classical shortened pipe-stem colon (Figure 69.1a), which lacks haustrations while increase in the presacral space (Figure 69.1b) is a typical finding in advanced disease. There might be strictures with cancer (Figure 69.21). Biopsies show that inflammation is confined to the mucosa with characteristic crypt abscess (Figure 69.22). A summary of the imaging procedures is shown in Tables 69.13 and 69.14.\nThe two main differential diagnoses are Crohn's disease and indeterminate colitis. Crohn's disease is diagnosed by segmental and transmural inflammation and its propensity to affect all parts of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Indeterminate colitis is diagnosed when clinical, endoscopic, radiologic and pathological features of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are present.\nThe emergency patient (5%) presents with cramp-like abdominal pain, tenesmus, faecal urgency, blood-stained diarrhoea and faecal incontinence. Bowel actions can be anything up to 12 times with extreme urgency. Failure to reach the toilet results in faecal incontinence.\nFever, malaise, anorexia, weight loss, dehydration and anaemia will be obvious. With fulminant colitis, the patient might be suffering from acute toxic megacolon bordering on perforation. The abdomen might be distended, tympanitic and tender (see previous multiple choice questions).\nThe complications of ulcerative colitis are enumerated in (Tables 69.1 and 69.2). One of the most serious complications is dysplastic change leading to cancer. Patients most vulnerable to malignant change are shown in Table 69.3. The indications for surgery are shown in Tables 69.4 and 69.5). The surgical options, elective operations and emergency operations are shown in Tables 69.15 and 69.16."

As an emergency they present as acute closed-loop large-bowel obstruction or perforation and peritonitis. Elective presentation is change in bowel habit in the form of increasing constipation because the stools are formed and bowel lumen in the descending colon is narrow. Sometimes there is a history of colicky abdominal pain due to impending obstruction. A barium enema (Figure 69.9) would show irregular stricture and filling defect with 'shouldering'.\nA colonoscopy is carried out to confirm the diagnosis by biopsy. In a stricture, it is highly unlikely that the entire colon will be visualised to exclude synchronous growths. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is carried out to accurately stage the disease. This is followed by discussion in a MDT meeting prior to definitive treatment. The definitive treatment is radical left hemicolectomy with end-to-end anastomosis between the transverse colon and upper rectum. Postoperatively in Dukes' stage C patients adjuvant chemotherapy is given.\nAll patients following large bowel surgery are placed in the enhanced recovery programme (ERP), the usual practice to reduce hospital stay and the metabolic response to the surgical insult. In this regard, patient education is commenced preoperatively by the surgical, anaesthetic and nursing teams."

Sometimes it is associated with aortic stenosis, when it is called Heyde's syndrome.\nThe typical presentation is with lower gastrointestinal bleeding that can be overt or occult. When the bleeding is overt it might be profuse, resulting in hypovolaemic shock. Initial management is resuscitation and stabilisation. This is followed by diagnostic evaluation usually by colonoscopy. In some cases three-vessel angiogram might be done when the pathology can be seen as a vascular blush. Therapeutic embolisation can be carried out at the same time.\nA CT angiogram is another diagnostic procedure; direct infusion of vasopressin will decrease or stop the bleeding. Colonoscopy could identify the bleeding site, which can then be managed by argon plasma coagulation, clips and adrenaline injection into the lesion. When bleeding cannot be controlled endoscopically, laparotomy is inevitable. On-table colonoscopy can sometimes localise the lesion when a segmental resection is carried out. If the bleeding site cannot be determined in spite of all available investigations, a subtotal colectomy might be necessary."

The team should be prepared for a long haul. If there is no distal obstruction, or pathology, or underlying sepsis, an enetrocutaneous fistula should close by good supportive management. It is essential to find the cause; in this case it is CD. The principles of management can be summarised by the acronym SNAP which stands for the following:\nSepsis elimination and Skin protection; Nutrition; Anatomical assessment; Planned surgery.\nTo achieve this goal, the principles of management must be instituted concurrently. Sepsis and skin: Under image guidance all sepsis must be eliminated by percutaneous drainage. Repeat CT scans, WCC count and CRP should be done. The role of the stoma nurse is very important to take care of skin excoriation, which can be very distressing for the patient.\nNutrition: In high-output fistula (> 500 mL/day) it will be necessary to establish total parenteral nutrition (TPN) as hypoproteinaemia must be combated.\nAnatomy is best defined by contrast studies, which might require barium meal, and follow through, barium enema and fistulography carried out in conjunction with CT scan. This is where the radiologist's input is vital.\nPlanned surgical procedure, which can be most challenging, is carried out only after the aforementioned principles have been optimally established. It might be necessary to perform staged procedures of exteriorisation to be followed by anastomosis when the conditions are right."

Once the patient has recovered from the acute episode, definitive treatment is planned after investigations in the form of a colonoscopy and contrast CT scan to exclude an unsuspected carcinoma within the diverticular segment. A sigmoid colectomy with end-to-end anastomosis is performed as an elective procedure.\nComplicated diverticulitis is stratified on CT scan according to the Hinchey classification which has the following four grades: Grade I – mesenteric or pericolic abscess; Grade II – pelvic abscess; Grade III – purulent peritonitis; Grade IV – faecal peritonitis. The first two grades can be treated by minimal-access surgery in the form of image-guided drainage and laparoscopic wash-outs under antibiotic cover while the higher grades will require laparotomy. Stricture is a complication that can mimic carcinoma with the typical radiological features of shouldering on barium enema (Figure 69.19a). In such patients a biopsy must be taken to exclude a carcinoma before performing a sigmoid resection (Figure 69.19b)."
