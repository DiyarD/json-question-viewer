            "explanation": "Cardiopulmonary bypass provides cardiac and respiratory support when the function of the heart and lungs needs to be temporarily interrupted. Advances in cardiopulmonary bypass have resulted in miniaturised circuits with possible advantages of reduced systemic inflammatory response, and the related complications. Cardiac surgery remains its principal domain, but it can be used in the management of patients outside cardiac surgery. For example, it facilitates the resection of renal and hepatic tumours invading the inferior vena cava, highly vascular tumours, extensive arteriovenous malformations and rewarming of patients with severe hypothermia."

            "explanation": "Complications can occur at the commencement, during and end of cardiopulmonary bypass. Exposure of blood to the non-physiological surfaces of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit evokes a systemic inflammatory response that can lead to multi-organ dysfunction. Whereas systemic embolic complications due to air and microemboli can occur with cardiopulmonary bypass, pulmonary embolism is not usually related to cardiopulmonary bypass. In fact, fully heparinising the patient should have a protective effect against pulmonary embolism in the early postoperative period. However, patients at risk for pulmonary embolism tend to develop this complication from about the seventh postoperative day especially if they are not commenced on deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and mobilised early."

            "explanation": "Survival benefit of surgery over angioplasty and stenting has been demonstrated in patients with the following:\n• >50% stenosis of the left main stem\n• >70% stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery\n• >70% stenosis of all three major coronary arteries (right coronary, left anterior descending and circumflex)\n• Coronary artery stenosis with poor left ventricular function\nRecent studies have also shown similar outcomes for diabetic patients and patients with severe calcific coronary artery disease (high SYNTHAX score).\nCoronary artery bypass grafting is performed using cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump) and without cardiopulmonary bypass (off-pump). The prospect of eliminating the systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with cardiopulmonary pass led to an upsurge in the use of off-pump more than a decade ago, but this practice has introduced a different set of concerns related to poor long-term graft patency. Recent data have shown that while early operative outcomes were similar, a higher re-intervention rate was observed with off-pump. Nevertheless, off-pump seems to have good outcomes in subsets of patients with renal failure and neurological dysfunction. Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) is used for single vessel (left anterior descending artery) bypass and has been shown recently to have better outcome than stenting.\nSelective coronary angiography demonstrates coronary anatomy and enables the visualisation of coronary artery size, evaluation of the site, extent and complexity of stenosis and assessment of the distal coronary to help plan surgery. It also allows an estimation of left ventricular function. Rare lesions that can affect outcome of surgery, such as coronary artery aneurysm and fistula, are also revealed. Selective coronary angiography provides comprehensive information, not possible with other imaging techniques, that is useful in developing a strategy for surgery. There is a growing role for CT angiography, which is noninvasive and better demonstrates the degree of calcification of proximal parts of the coronary arteries. Its role in current practice is largely supplementary to coronary angiography.\nRisk-scoring systems, like the EuroSCORE (European system for cardiac operative risk evaluation) and STS (The Society of Thoracic Surgeons) risk score, allocate scores to each risk factor in a patient that are added up to calculate the predicted operative mortality. These risk calculators are available online and used routinely to provide an estimate of the operative mortality for patients' informed consent.\nVenous and arterial grafts are the major conduits used for coronary artery bypass surgery. The long saphenous vein is the most common vein conduit used and the left internal mammary artery is the most common arterial conduit, and the graft of choice for the left anterior descending artery. Venous grafts are susceptible to atherosclerosis, resulting in a 10-year patency rate of 50%–60% for the long saphenous vein. By comparison, arterial grafts are better protected against atherosclerosis. The left internal mammary artery has a 10-year patency rate of 90%. There is a growing trend to use the right internal mammary artery as emerging evidence supports its longer-term patency compared with vein grafts. The concept of total arterial revascularisation (the use of only arterial conduits) where appropriate, is promising and continues to be investigated."

            ],
            "explanation": "Biological valves are made or obtained from animal or human tissue. While valves obtained from humans (homograft and autograft) are harvested and implanted without major alteration of the configuration, valves made from animal tissue (heterograft) are constructed to resemble human valves and are mounted on a frame (stented) or frameless (stentless). Among biological valves, heterografts are most commonly used; specifically, stented heterografts are the most frequently implanted. Biological valves are non-thrombogenic, so do not require lifelong anticoagulation.\nBiological valves, unlike mechanical valves, are subject to degenerative changes, which lead to structural failure, and hence their durability is limited. Younger patients are probably more vulnerable. The need to replace a prosthetic valve also arises if there is a paravalvular leak causing haemodynamic instability or haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis of the valve, thromboembolism related to the valve and infection of the valve (prosthetic valve endocarditis). Homografts and autografts (entirely human tissues) are less susceptible to thrombosis or thromboembolism and infection. Mechanical valves and the other biological valves have low risks of paravalvular leak, infection and thrombosis or thromboembolism.\nThe choice of the valve type to implant in a patient is influenced by age and other factors, including clinical considerations (like co-existing medical conditions such as bleeding disorders), patient lifestyle (heavy alcohol use) and patient choice."

                "B",
                "C"
            ],
            "explanation": "Surgery is performed in mitral valve disease to relieve symptoms and improve survival (prognostic). Severe symptoms, however, are not the only indication for surgery. For mitral regurgitation, progressive left ventricular dilatation or dysfunction and severe onset of regurgitation are the other indications. With increasing numbers of mitral regurgitation being repaired rather than replaced, and the low mortality risk of repair in the early phase of the disease, there is a trend to advocate surgery even in asymptomatic patients with morphological changes (increase in cardiac dimensions) and functional changes (impaired left ventricular function) with or without new onset atrial fibrillation. For mitral stenosis, the other indications are the severity of stenosis (moderate and severe stenosis with valve area of ≤1.5 cm²) and systemic emboli.\nThe onset of mitral regurgitation has implications for changes in cardiac morphology and function, and consequently the strategy for surgical correction. In mitral regurgitation, retrograde ejection leads to an increase in left ventricular volume load. The amount of retrograde ejection increases slowly in chronic mitral regurgitation, allowing adaptive changes like progressive left ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, and left atrial dilatation, to develop without substantial pressure increase. As a result the pulmonary circulation is protected from developing a sudden increase in pressure. Acute mitral regurgitation does not allow time for these compensatory changes. High-volume retrograde flow into a small left atrium causes a sudden surge in left atrial pressure and a back-pressure increase affecting the pulmonary venous circulation, leading to pulmonary congestion and oedema. Chronic mitral regurgitation, however, ultimately causes congestive cardiac failure when the compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed.\nAcute mitral regurgitation presents with sudden onset and rapidly progressive dyspnoea with clinical and radiological evidence of pulmonary oedema. Chronic mitral regurgitation is usually asymptomatic until pulmonary congestion and left ventricular failure develop. Then symptoms like fatigue, dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnoea and atrial fibrillation (due to left atrial enlargement) occur, and left ventricular enlargement becomes apparent radiologically. A loud apical pansystolic murmur is audible in both acute and chronic mitral regurgitation."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Aortic stenosis and chronic aortic regurgitation are usually asymptomatic until cardiac decompensation occurs. Compensatory mechanisms include ventricular hypertrophy (increase in wall thickness) to overcome the left ventricular outflow obstruction of aortic stenosis and left ventricular dilatation to accommodate the increased left ventricular volume load due to aortic regurgitation. With cardiac decompensation, and acute aortic regurgitation, patients develop exertional dyspnoea and angina. Syncope is also common with aortic stenosis.\nMarked differences exist with clinical findings. A harsh systolic ejection murmur, heard loudest in the aortic area and radiating to the carotids, is typical of aortic stenosis.\nThe distinctive features of aortic regurgitation are due largely to a wide pulse pressure and include the following:\n• Collapsing pulse (water-hammer pulse)\n• Visible capillary pulsation in the nail bed (Quincke's sign)\n• Pulsatile head bobbing (de Musset's sign)\n• Visible pulsation of neck arteries (Corrigan's sign)\n• ‘Pistol shot' sound on auscultation of the femoral artery (Traube's sign)\n• Uvular pulsation (Müller's sign).\nIn aortic regurgitation also, the apex beat is often visible and displaced laterally. The characteristic murmur of aortic regurgitation is high-pitched, mid-diastolic and best heard at the left sternal border. The electrocardiographic and radiological appearances are not usually distinctive."

            "explanation": "In total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, pulmonary venous return is into the systemic venous circulation usually through a communication with the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, coronary sinus, or right atrium, instead of left atrium. The typical presentation is cyanosis after the first week of life. If there is a co-existent atrial septal defect, cyanosis is minimal even with high pulmonary flow.\nThe aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle in transposition of the great vessels. This arrangement allows the pulmonary and systemic circulation to run in parallel rather than in series. As oxygenated blood is confined to the pulmonary circulation and deoxygenated blood to the systemic circulation, this condition is not compatible with life. Associated defects like foramen ovale and ventricular septal defect provide channels for mixing of blood. Transposition of the great vessels is the most common congenital heart disease, causing cyanosis in the newborn period, and, in general, the second-most common cyanotic congenital heart disease after tetralogy of Fallot."

            "explanation": "1. E Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest\nThe diagnosis of thoracic aneurysm can be confirmed by CT of the chest. The site, size and presence of thrombi can be assessed. As descending thoracic aneurysm is often managed conservatively, CT is useful for serial assessment of the aneurysm to determine when surgery is indicated, due to acute enlargement or progressive increase in size to more than 6 cm.\n2. D Echocardiography\nMarfan's syndrome is associated with cystic medial necrosis of the vessel wall, causing weakness and dilatation of the vessel. The aortic root and ascending aorta are commonly affected. Aortic regurgitation due to aortic root dilatation is common. The presence of clinical features of aortic regurgitation in the setting of ascending aortic aneurysm warrants further investigation. Echocardiography assesses the severity of regurgitation, diameter of the aortic root, aortic valve morphology and left ventricular dimensions and function. The information provided by echocardiography is vital in deciding the optimal type of surgical repair.\n3. B Emergency resternotomy\nEmergency resternotomy contributes to the high survival rate reported for cardiac arrests following cardiac surgery. Early re-sternotomy is strongly recommended if a stable cardiac output is not achieved within 5 minutes of the onset of the cardiac arrest. Internal cardiac massage should be performed at a rate of 100 beats per minute, with an aim to achieve systolic arterial pressure of at least 60 mmHg. Emergency resternotomy should be considered until 10 days postoperatively. In some situations, it might be necessary to institute cardiopulmonary bypass.\n4. A Ischaemic heart disease\nSurgical revascularisation for ischaemic heart disease is achieved by coronary artery bypass grafting, one of the most investigated surgical procedures with well and consistently documented complications. An estimate of the operative mortality can be calculated using risk-stratification systems like the EuroSCORE or STS score. Surgery for mitral valve disease is associated with a higher operative risk, approximately 5%–6%, and greater risk for neurological complications.\n5. C Mitral regurgitation\nEven with stable symptoms due to adequate medical therapy, ischaemic heart disease can still cause morphological complications and remains a common cause of mitral regurgitation (ischaemic mitral regurgitation) as a result of its local or global effects. Regional myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction cause papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture. Global myocardial ischaemia causes left ventricular dysfunction and dilatation, which pull the mitral leaflets apart so that functional mitral regurgitation occurs in the presence of grossly normal mitral valve leaflets."
