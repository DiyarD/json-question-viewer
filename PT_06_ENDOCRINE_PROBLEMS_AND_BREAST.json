                "b. It is commonly seen as a consequence of metastasis of distant cancers, such as lung or breast, to the adrenal glands",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "*   Failure to recognize adrenal cortical insufficiency, particularly in the postoperative patient, may be a fatal error.\n*   This error is especially regrettable because therapy (exogenous steroids) is effective and easy to administer.\n*   Adrenal insufficiency may occur in a host of settings including tuberculosis (formerly the most common cause), autoimmune states, severe infections (classically, meningococcal septicemia), pituitary insufficiency, after burns, during anticoagulant therapy, and most commonly today after interruption of chronically administered exogenous steroids.\n*   Although the adrenal gland is an occasional site for distant metastases, such as from lung or breast, it is rare for there to be enough destruction of the glands to produce clinical adrenal insufficiency.\n*   Chronic adrenal insufficiency (classic Addison's disease) should be recognizable preoperatively by the constellation of skin pigmentation, weakness, weight loss, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia.\n*   Death may occur within hours of surgery if a patient with Addison's disease is operated on without cognizance of adrenal insufficiency and pretreatment with exogenous steroids.\n*   Patients who have adrenal insufficiency as a result of interruption of chronically administered exogenous steroids may not develop the classic electrolyte abnormalities until the preterminal period.\n*   Adrenal insufficiency may also develop insidiously in the postoperative period, progressing over a course of several days.\n*   This insidious course is seen when adrenal injury occurs in the perioperative period, as would be the case with adrenal damage from hemorrhage into the gland in a patient receiving postoperative anticoagulant therapy.\n*   Measurement of blood corticosteroid levels, urinary corticosteroid secretion, urinary sodium levels, and the response to exogenous steroids is helpful in establishing the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "*   The thyroid scan illustrated in the question shows a single focus of increased isotope uptake, often referred to as a “hot” nodule; the remainder of the thyroid gland has not taken up radioactive iodine.\n*   Hyperfunctioning adenomas become independent of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) control and secrete thyroid hormone autonomously, which results in clinical hyperthyroidism.\n*   The elevated thyroid hormone levels ultimately diminish TSH levels severely and thus depress function of the remaining normal thyroid gland.\n*   An isolated focus of increased uptake on a thyroid scan is virtually diagnostic of a hyperfunctioning adenoma.\n*   Carcinomas usually display diminished uptake and are called “cold” nodules.\n*   Graves' disease would probably manifest as a diffusely hyperactive gland without nodularity.\n*   Multinodular goiter would display many nodules with varying activity."

            "explanation": "*   Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common disease, with over 100,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States, usually in women.\n*   Essential to the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is the finding of hypercalcemia.\n*   Though there are many causes of hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism is by far the most prevalent.\n*   With rare exceptions, operations for primary hyperparathyroidism should not be performed unless the patient is hypercalcemic.\n*   Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is not invariably elevated, but it should be elevated relative to the serum calcium level.\n*   Ordinarily, high serum calcium levels suppress parathyroid secretion.\n*   Therefore, in the presence of hypercalcemia, normal levels of PTH are “abnormal.”\n*   Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have either normal or elevated urinary calcium.\n*   As the name suggests, patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) have hypercalcemia.\n*   They also usually have elevated PTH, but surgery is not indicated in this relatively rare setting of hypercalcemia."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "*   Somatostatin is produced by D cells in the pancreatic islets and in a variety of other tissue sites in the central nervous system, gut, and elsewhere.\n*   It is a potent inhibitory regulator of intestinal hormones and motility.\n*   Because it was originally found in the hypothalamus, somatostatin earned its name because it was believed to be a major inhibitor of secretion of growth hormone.\n*   It has now been shown to inhibit the secretion of most GI hormones, particularly insulin and glucagon, as well as gastrin, secretin, VIP, PP, gastric acid, pepsin, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, renin, and calcitonin.\n*   It also inhibits intestinal, biliary, and gastric motility, and is occasionally of value in controlling bowel fistulas by sharply reducing the amount of drainage.\n*   It has no known effect on adrenocortical cells."

            "explanation": "*   Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid frequently metastasizes to cervical lymph nodes, but distant metastasis is uncommon.\n*   The nonaggressive nature of this tumor locally and the infrequency of distant metastases combine to produce an 80–95% 5-year survival rate.\n*   A contributing factor to the success of thyroid surgery for papillary carcinoma is the easy accessibility of cervical nodes for examination and dissection.\n*   Slow growth and a predilection for local extension are characteristics of this tumor that contribute to a high survival rate in affected persons.\n*   This is true even of patients who have limited surgery, which has led to considerable controversy regarding the extent of the indicated surgical procedure."
