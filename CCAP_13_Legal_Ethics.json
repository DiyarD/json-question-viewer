            "explanation": "- According to medical ethics scholar, Griffin Trotter, medical futility occurs when there is a goal, an action to achieve this goal, and certainty that the action will not achieve the goal.\\n- Interventions can be medically futile if they do not produce any benefit to the patient.\\n- Medical futility should not be applied to the overall care of the patient but to specific interventions at a particular time.\\n- Medical treatment in this woman with dementia for cellulitis is not futile, and the outcome of treating the cellulitis with antibiotics is desirable.\\n- The plan of care does not need to be determined by all family members, and an ethics committee does not need to be involved.\\n- Therefore, responding to the son that the treatment plan may achieve its goal is the correct answer."

Paramedics were on the scene approximately 15 minutes after the event and had a 5-minute scene time. He had no pulse on assessment, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was continued during the 15-minute transport. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation is held at the direction of the trauma team leader to facilitate the patient's assessment. On examination, he is apneic, he has absent breath sounds, absent cardiac sounds, no carotid pulse, no pupillary response, and his extremities are flaccid. He has large penetrating wounds to the back of his head and to his right flank. He is connected to the telemetry monitor, which demonstrates a wide complex, bradycardic rhythm.

            "explanation": "- A patient with decision-making capacity has the right to decline any medical intervention or ask that an intervention be stopped, even if it is expected to lead to death, and regardless of terminal illness (American Medical Association Principles of Medical Ethics).\\n- The controversy regarding the difference between withholding and withdrawing treatment is not fully resolved, but advances in biotechnology have resurrected the debate.\\n- Clinicians and patients may harbor values that cast doubt on withdrawing treatment, especially for internal devices.\\n- Medical ethics and the rule of law have not wavered in the position that there is no distinction between withholding and withdrawing treatment.\\n- A competent patient has the right to accept, refuse, or terminate a treatment already in place.\\n- Terminating treatment is usually prompted by the patient's decision that the burden of continuing therapy outweighs potential benefits or no longer aligns with values/goals.\\n- This applies to all types of treatment and is not dependent on location (internal vs. external), duration, or continuity.\\n- The only exception is treatment that has become a living part of the patient (e.g., transplanted organ).\\n- The withdrawal of a life-sustaining treatment expected to result in death is not intentional killing; it is based on the principles of \"intent\" and \"cause\" of death.\\n- Deactivation of an implanted cardioverter defibrillator at a patient's request acknowledges the patient's decision that the burden of the intervention has exceeded its benefit, not an intent by the physician to kill.\\n- The deactivation of the device itself is not the cause of the patient's death; the cause is the underlying cardiac condition."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Four legal and ethical principles form the foundation of a patient's right to choose or refuse medical treatment: autonomy, beneficence, nonmalfeasance, and justice.\\n- Appropriateness of an intervention is within good medical/surgical practice but is not a foundational ethical principle.\\n- These principles, while appealing, frequently conflict.\\n- Individual justice is fair and equitable treatment for all. Distributive justice often becomes problematic when healthcare resource distribution (e.g., ICU beds) compromises community betterment.\\n- Beneficence implies interventions are in the patient's best interest, with accurate assessment of risk vs. benefit.\\n- Nonmalfeasance implies \"do no harm\" (primum non nocere).\\n- Beneficence and nonmalfeasance are the oldest principles, rooted in the Hippocratic code, forming the sole basis of the first Code of Medical Ethics (1847).\\n- Of the four principles, autonomy is considered the most important.\\n- This concept was applied to patient care in the early 20th century (Schloendorff v. New York Hospital), establishing a patient's right to determine what happens to their own body, shifting from paternalism.\\n- Self-determination is the basis for an individual's right to accept or refuse interventions based on understanding benefits/risks and alignment with values/beliefs.\\n- Physicians are legally and ethically bound to adhere to patient wishes, even if they believe the decision is in error."

Neurosurgery and neurology consultants both concur that his chances of meaningful neurologic recovery are nil. However, he breathes on an apnea trial.

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Organ donation after cardiac death (DCD) usually involves mechanically ventilated patients with severe, irreversible brain injuries.\\n- The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) developed DCD rules.\\n- Mechanical asystole is defined as the absence of arterial pulsations. Electromechanical asystole is absence of both electrical and mechanical cardiac activity.\\n- Broad consensus is that mechanical asystole is sufficient to determine death, as death is the absence of circulation, not cardiac electrical activity.\\n- Pulseless electrical activity (mechanical asystole without circulation) is immaterial to death determination.\\n- The DCD process begins with candidate identification, full informed consent from legal next of kin, withdrawal of care, and organ retrieval.\\n- When the cardiac death criterion is met, a doctor pronounces the patient dead.\\n- Time from mechanical asystole to death declaration is generally 5 minutes, but can be as short as 2 minutes.\\n- Circulation does not spontaneously return after 2 minutes.\\n- To avoid conflict of interest, neither the surgeon performing organ retrieval nor transplant personnel participate in end-of-life care or death declaration.\\n- Asystole can be assessed by palpating arterial pulses and listening for heartbeat, but for DCD, indwelling arterial catheters are used for more accurate and reproducible measurements of pulselessness.\\n- Percutaneous Doppler ultrasound of peripheral arteries and echocardiography can also be helpful.\\n- Transcranial Doppler is not indicated, as the patient is not brain dead.\\n- Returning the patient to mechanical ventilatory support is not indicated once mechanical asystole confirms death."

            "explanation": "- After initial evaluation for blunt force trauma, imaging to investigate for occult blood loss is indicated in a patient who has responded to resuscitation.\\n- In the pregnant trauma patient, the edict \"what's good for the mother, is good for the fetus\" applies.\\n- At 35 weeks' gestation, organogenesis is complete, and the fetus is viable.\\n- Concerns for radiation exposure in the secondary evaluation should be overruled by the need to rapidly diagnose and treat any ongoing hemorrhage.\\n- CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a quick and sensitive way to search for occult injury and ongoing blood loss.\\n- Pregnancy should not prevent scanning of the pelvis for a source of blood loss.\\n- Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is relatively contraindicated in advanced gestations.\\n- MRI, although associated with less fetal radiation exposure, is reserved for secondary studies in hemodynamically normal blunt force trauma patients.\\n- The focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam would be difficult to interpret in a pregnant female at 35 weeks' gestation."

            "explanation": "- Obtaining informed consent before elective surgery is a critical part of surgical practice.\\n- When obtaining consent, a surgeon must determine whether the patient has capacity to understand what he or she is being told.\\n- Competence, conversely, denotes a legal status determined by judicial review.\\n- In most situations, it is reasonable for the surgeon to determine whether the patient has the capacity to understand and consent.\\n- Legal criteria for consent vary but generally include the ability to (1) understand relevant information, (2) communicate a choice, (3) appreciate the medical consequences, and (4) reason about treatment choices.\\n- The act of communicating a treatment choice requires indication of the choice made and does not necessarily require a verbal response.\\n- Mild cognitive impairment or early dementia do not necessarily preclude a patient's ability to make a competent decision, but psychiatric consultation is helpful and should be documented carefully when present or suspected.\\n- Translators may be required when English is not the patient's primary language.\\n- A systematic review found that professional interpreters (rather than family members) decrease communication errors and improve facility use, clinical outcomes, and satisfaction.\\n- Failure to obtain informed consent is \"tantamount to no consent.\"\\n- Battery is defined as an unauthorized touching or invasion of a patient's body and is considered an intentional tort.\\n- Claims against doctors based on battery typically are restricted to cases in which physicians did not obtain informed consent or exceeded the scope of a consent."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Good Samaritan laws (volunteer protection acts) exist at both federal and state levels, varying somewhat between jurisdictions.\\n- Generally, three requirements qualify a licensed physician for immunity from medical negligence: (1) the treatment must be voluntary and the physician must not owe the patient a prior duty, (2) the treatment rendered must be in a true emergency, and (3) treatment must be rendered outside a hospital or other place with medical equipment.\\n- The concept of \"duty\" is important: if the surgeon provides emergency voluntary care to his own patient, a pre-existing duty before the emergency would likely nullify a Good Samaritan claim.\\n- If a surgeon agrees to assist another surgeon before an emergency, a duty to the patient is created.\\n- Being \"on call\" implies a duty to anyone who requires the on-call physician's services, potentially excluding a Good Samaritan claim."
