However, 5%-7% of 45- to 64-year-olds report problems as a chronic illness. The lifetime prevalence of sciatica is 2%-4%, with 70% of acute episodes resolving within 3 months."

            "explanation": "The spine is straight in the coronal plane with the head centred over the sacrum, but in the sagittal (side) plane there is the following:\n• Cervical lordosis (range 20–45 degrees)\n• Thoracic kyphosis (range 20–50 degrees), which increases with age\n• Lumbar lordosis (range 40–80 degrees), occurs predominantly between L4 to S1\nThe thoracic kyphosis balances the cervical and lumbar lordosis. The spinal cord terminates at the level of L1. The spinal nerve roots comprise 8 cervical (7 vertebrae), 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral and 1 coccygeal. The blood supply to the spinal cord is from the vertebral, deep cervical, intercostal and lumbar arteries, supplying the anterior spinal artery (majority of blood supply) and two posterior spinal arteries. The lower spinal cord is supplied by the anterior spinal artery, which is mainly supplied by the radicular artery of Adamkiewicz. Injury to this artery can lead to critical ischaemia of the cord. It is found on the left side in 80% of patients, originating anywhere from T5 to L5 (ventral roots T9–T11 commonly)."

Plain radiographs are not useful in the early detection of tumour or infection, as 40%-60% of bone mass destruction is required before it is detected. The best way to image the soft tissue of the spine (disc, thecal sac, nerve roots) is MRI, with CT the investigation of choice for bony pathology. Osteoporosis cannot be diagnosed reliably on radiographs or by scintigraphy, with bone densitometry being used."

Lytic pars defect, i.e., pars fatigue fracture\nb. Elongated or attenuated pars\nc. Acute pars fracture\n3 Degenerative: Facet joint segmental instability due to disc and facet joint degeneration\n4 Traumatic: Acute fracture involving posterior elements (not pars)\n5 Pathological: Pathological destruction associated with bone disease, e.g., metabolic or neoplastic\n6 Postsurgical: Sometimes considered part of traumatic"

            "answer": "10",
            "explanation": "The history is classical of spinal stenosis, which is the narrowing of the spinal canal, nerve root canal, or foramen caused by a combination of facet joint hypertrophy (e.g., osteophytes), disc bulge or herniation, ligament flavum hypertrophy, or facet cysts. Resultant neural compression and ischaemia leads to back, buttock and leg pain that is worse when walking. It can be congenital, e.g., achondroplasia (medial facets and short pedicles), post-trauma or surgery, inflammatory (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis), or degenerative, with the latter normally presenting between 50 and 70 years of age. It is essential to differentiate spinal and vascular claudication, as with both causes of pain is initiated on exercise. However, standing stationary relieves symptoms of vascular claudication (postural changes not seen), whereas not stopping but flexion (leaning forward) relieves spinal claudication. Generally, with vascular claudication patients get pain going uphill (when the leg muscles require more oxygen and the spine is flexed), while spinal claudicants get worse pain going downhill (when the spinal canal narrows in extension). Generally, patients with spinal claudication will have normal distal pulses unless they have concomitant peripheral vascular disease. Bladder symptoms can occur in some patients, although cauda equina syndrome is rare. Diagnosis is confirmed with CT or MRI, with some quoting an AP diameter of less than 10 mm or a cross-sectional area of less than 100 mm². Spinal claudication only progresses in around one-third of cases, and if it does spinal decompression +/– fusion can offer symptom relief."

Routine investigations include bloods (FBC, UEs, LFTs, CRP, ESR, PSA, TFTs), plain radiographs (chest and spine; absent pedicles, vertebral erosion or collapse), CT, bone scan and bone biopsy, e.g., open or CT-guided. Whole-spine MRI is used to detect metastases and neurological compromise. Treatment includes analgesia, steroids, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and potentially surgery, e.g., for spinal cord decompression – stabilisation and postoperative radiotherapy."

            "answer": "1",
            "explanation": "In this case, a cauda equine syndrome (central lumbar disc prolapse or herniation) has to be excluded. It is unlikely to be occult malignancy or an aneurysm, as the patient is too young and transverse myelitis is not usually painful. It is rare (2%–6% of all lumbar disc herniations), more common in men and routinely seen between 20 and 45 years of age. The most common cause is a large central disc prolapse at the L4/5 level. There are no completely reliable signs of central disc prolapse, but saddle anaesthesia and loss of anal tone (faecal incontinence) are important (Table 35.1). Bladder changes include painless retention initially followed by overflow incontinence. Absence of pain does not exclude the diagnosis nor do unilateral signs. They are commonly associated with a single nerve root trapped in the lateral foramen (a paracentral or lateral disc protrusion). Urgent MRI confirms the diagnosis. There is evidence that if surgical decompression is carried out within 24 hours of the loss of bowel or bladder control, the chance of recovery is better and so an immediate referral to a spine surgeon or unit is recommended."

            "answer": "4",
            "explanation": "Symptomatic lumbar disc herniation is rare (2%–5% of the population), more common in males, routinely seen between 30 and 50 years of age, and more than 90% occur at the L5/S1 and L4/L5 levels (Figure 35.2). Other risk factors include heavy manual work or lifting, occupation, socioeconomic deprivation, and smoking. Patients often present with back pain followed by unilateral radicular leg pain. A spectrum of neurological signs can be found including paraesthesia, motor weakness, absent reflexes, and a positive straight leg-raise test. In this case, the pain radiates down to the foot, suggesting that it is radicular rather than referred, so facet joint arthritis and discitis or infection are unlikely to be the cause. The motor supply to extensor hallucis longus is from L5 (Table 35.2), and the dermatomal distribution of L5 is the dorsum of the foot and lateral side of the calf. This will be caused by a posterolateral or paracentral disc herniation at L4/L5 or a far-lateral or extra-foraminal herniation at L5/S1. MRI confirms the diagnosis. Conservative management (physiotherapy, analgesia) results in symptoms settling within three months for 70%–90% of patients. Nerve root steroid injections may be helpful. For cases where the symptoms persist, micro-discectomy is employed."

            "answer": "3",
            "explanation": "The patient's age, gender, and clinical findings are consistent with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. A coronal curve is a scoliosis, whereas a sagittal deformity can be a lordosis or kyphosis. Normal abdominal reflexes suggest that a neuromuscular scoliosis is unlikely. Lung function is commonly affected in neuromuscular or early-onset scoliosis but is rarely affected in idiopathic adolescent scoliosis. Risk factors for progression of the curve include females, how much more growth is anticipated, and the rate at which it is occurring, along with curve type (thoracic worse than lumbar, double worse than single) and size. Curves normally stabilise at skeletal maturity. The severity of a scoliosis curve is measured with Cobb's angle on standard full PA and lateral standing views of the spine, with a right thoracic curve most common. Cobb's angle (>10 degrees diagnostic) measures the maximum angle of the spine curvature on the PA view (Figure 35.3). The Lenke classification is more comprehensive and aids to guide treatment. Risser's staging is a method to determine skeletal maturity from the closure of epiphyseal growth plates in the pelvis and therefore predicts how much more growth (and deformity) potential there is in the skeleton. MRI is used to exclude intra-spinal anomalies, e.g., Arnold-Chiari malformation, syrinx. Treatment is determined by the size of the curve and anticipated progression of the curve. For a Cobb angle of <25 degrees, observation with serial radiographs is recommended. Bracing aims to limit curve progression but will not correct the curve, thus the use is limited to skeletally immature patients with flexible curves between 25 and 45 degrees. For angles >40-45 degrees or trunk imbalance, surgery with continuous electrical spinal cord monitoring is indicated. Options include the following:\n• Posterior instrumented spinal fusion (most common)\n• Anterior instrumented spinal fusion\n• Combined"
