            ],
            "explanation": "These simple interventions all reduce the risk of surgical infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis, where appropriate, as well as meticulous asepsis are key components. Perioperative hypothermia not only increases the risk of infection but also impairs wound healing, glucose control and coagulation pathways. Hypothermic patients are also more likely to experience cardiac events. Blood sugar control is discussed in Chapter 18."

                "D",

            ],
            "explanation": "The theatre is kept at a positive pressure to prevent ingress of infective material. Airflow in theatre is from ceiling to floor to prevent stirring up dirt and dust from floors, which can contaminate the operative field. Theatre humidity is kept at 50% to 60% to minimise the risk of static electrical charge build up. Twenty air changes per hour is the minimum requirement. Optimal ambient temperature is 20–24°C, which represents a compromise between reducing the risk of patients becoming hypothermic and allowing comfortable operating conditions."

            ],
            "explanation": "Distal vascular status should be assessed prior to use of a tourniquet, as it is contraindicated in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Postoperatively, the return of circulation should also be noted. Tourniquets should be placed as proximally as possible to allow access to the operative site. Sickling of red blood cells in patients with sickle cell disease occurs in response to hypoxia, and tourniquets are therefore contraindicated in these patients. The maximum safe tourniquet inflation time is 1.5 hours. Longer times risk irreversible ischaemic damage to muscle, nerves and vasculature. Tourniquets should be inflated to 100 mmHg above systolic BP for the arm and 150 mmHg for the leg."

            ],
            "explanation": "Universal precautions to prevent contamination with blood or other body fluids must be maintained in all patient care situations. Obese patients are difficult to position safely and are therefore at increased risk of nerve injuries and pressure sores. The risk of corneal abrasions under general anaesthesia is around 1 in 2800. Tape, ointment and protective pads can prevent this occurring. During prolonged surgery, limbs not involved in surgery should be moved regularly to prevent pressure sores and nerve injuries. The incidence of significant nerve damage under general anaesthesia is less than 1 in 2000. The nerves most commonly affected are the ulnar nerve in the arm and common peroneal nerve in the leg. Common peroneal nerve injury can lead to numbness over the dorsum of the foot and foot drop."

            ],
            "explanation": "With monopolar diathermy, the entire surface area of the plate should be in contact with skin over tissues with a good blood supply to prevent burns. It should therefore not be placed on bony prominences, scar tissue and hairy skin. The plate should also not be placed over implanted metal work to avoid heating effects. The current path should be short and not travel through susceptible tissue or medical devices. Therefore, the pad should be placed close to the operative site. Ideally bipolar diathermy should be used in patients with pacemakers or implantable cardiodefibrillators, as the current is confined to the instrument tip. The patient must not be in contact with any other metal surfaces. The risk of electrocution increases if they are earthed, because current can flow between the diathermy and the earthed appliance."

            ],
            "explanation": "It is essential that the patient confirms the identity and details of the planned procedure prior to the start of anaesthesia. At this point, the patient's name-bands should also be checked. A further 'time out' check just prior to starting surgery should be done once the patient is anaesthetised. One of the main aims of the surgical safety checklist is to encourage communication between members of the theatre team. It encourages team members to speak out when potential problems are detected and improves list efficiency. The ‘pre list brief' is therefore arguably one of the most important parts of the five-step WHO process, and is not optional. Ensuring that the sign-out checks are completed is the responsibility of the entire theatre team. Clear, written postoperative instructions must be completed in a timely manner for when the patient leaves theatre."
