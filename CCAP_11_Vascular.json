            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Arterial puncture is more likely to occur with an internal jugular rather than a subclavian approach (3% vs 0.5%).\n- Subclavian access is more likely to be complicated by pneumothorax or hemothorax.\n- Real-time ultrasound prevents arterial injury in the internal jugular position, reducing the risk of complications (from 8.4% to 1.4%).\n- Experience also reduces the risk of complications: Catheter insertion by a physician with more than 50 prior insertions is half as likely to result in a mechanical complication.\n- More than 3 insertion attempts during one procedure is 6 times more likely to lead to a complication; after 3 attempts, the surgeon should abort or ask for assistance.\n- Pressure monitoring, with either column manometry or pressure transducer before dilator placement, potentially prevents arterial injury.\n- Neck positioning (generally best to place a roll behind shoulders), fine-gauge needle use, and steep Trendelenburg positioning are good practices that facilitate the procedure, but neither definitively reduces the risk of inadvertent arterial catheterization."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- This patient is presenting with chronic mesenteric ischemia, a disorder in which blood flow to the intestines is inadequate.\n- The main etiology of chronic mesenteric ischemia is atherosclerosis of the celiac, superior mesenteric, or inferior mesenteric arteries; rare causes include median arcuate ligament syndrome, vasculitis, or fibromuscular dysplasia.\n- Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is a form of chronic mesenteric ischemia that occurs in patients with a low flow state; there is a female preponderance.\n- The most important finding is postprandial pain, usually occurring 90 minutes to 2 hours after a meal, leading to fear of eating, smaller meals, missed meals, and weight loss.\n- Patients may also present with diarrhea. In end-stage chronic mesenteric ischemia, pain patterns may change to more constant abdominal pain.\n- Chronic mesenteric ischemia can present with ulcers in the stomach; elderly patients with ulcers where Helicobacter pylori is negative and no NSAID use should undergo screening for chronic mesenteric ischemia.\n- Diagnosis is first and foremost clinical.\n- Duplex ultrasound is a good screening test (no radiation) but is operator dependent and limited where experience is not high.\n- CT angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for chronic mesenteric ischemia, providing 3-dimensional imaging of vasculature and ruling out other causes of abdominal pain.\n- Hepatobiliary scanning is typically used for biliary disease, not indicated by the patient's symptoms.\n- Upper endoscopy and colonoscopy could be considered, but in this patient with postprandial pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, these tests would only lead to confusion and delay treatment.\n- There is no indication for diagnostic laparoscopy."

            "explanation": "- Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is common in elderly patients.\n- A history of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair should always raise suspicion for an aortoenteric fistula (AEF).\n- AEFs are more common in patients with open AAA repair (compared to endovascular repair), typically occurring 1 to 5 years post-op.\n- The most common etiology is graft infection with an anastomotic pseudoaneurysm eroding into adjacent bowel.\n- Fistulas usually involve the proximal aortic anastomosis and the distal duodenum.\n- More than 70% of patients initially present with a \"herald bleed\" followed shortly by high-volume hemorrhage and death.\n- AEFs are missed on >85% of endoscopic evaluations due to their distal nature; CT scan has 93% sensitivity.\n- Swift action is needed to avoid exsanguination.\n- Historically, surgical outcomes were poor, but a newer study showed 21% overall mortality at 30 days (0% for normotensive at surgery vs. 60% for those in shock).\n- Antibiotics and bowel rest are inadequate to prevent hemorrhage and death as they do not remove the fistula or septic focus.\n- Endoscopic clipping is inadequate to address the infected graft.\n- Most experts agree that the entire graft must be explanted to eliminate infection and prevent further pseudoaneurysms.\n- After fistula repair and graft excision, the aorta is oversewn, and distal perfusion is restored with an extra-anatomic bypass to avoid graft contamination.\n- Endoscopic injection of a fibrin sealant with an endovascular stent is described for thoracic AEFs; while promising, there is insufficient evidence to support its utility in abdominal AEFs.\n- Endovascular stenting of AEFs has emerged as a reasonable alternative to graft excision and extra-anatomic bypass, associated with lower in-hospital mortality but ~50% risk of reinfection.\n- Stenting is typically used as a bridge to definitive open surgery for hemodynamically abnormal or otherwise unfit patients."

Lepirudin is no longer manufactured.\n- Bivalirudin is effective in preventing thrombotic complications, but it is renally excreted and relatively contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency.\n- Warfarin should not be used in the acute setting as it decreases proteins C and S, which can worsen thrombotic risk.\n- Warfarin can be started at low doses (5 mg/day) when platelet counts increase >150,000/mm³, overlapping with a nonheparin anticoagulant for at least 5 days.\n- Direct oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban) are under investigation but not currently recommended to treat HIT."
