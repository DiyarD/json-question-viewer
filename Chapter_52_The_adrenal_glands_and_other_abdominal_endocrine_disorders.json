            "explanation": "MEN1 is associated with a triad of anterior pituitary tumours (prolactinoma or nonfunctional tumours), primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) and pancreaticoduodenal tumours (PET).\nMEN2 have the following three subtypes: familial medullary carcinoma, MEN2a (MTC, pHPT and phaeochromocytoma) and MEN2b (features of MEN2a and neuromas and a marfanoid habitus). They are all inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and genetic counselling with screening of family members is helpful.\nThe prevalence of the syndrome is 0.04â€“0.2 cases per 1000 population per year, but the penetrance of the mutation is high with almost 100% of carriers developing the syndrome. In particular MEN2 shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation."

Renal stone disease is a common presentation. Measurement of serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and Ca, PO4 in both serum and urine confirms pHPT. Pancreatic endocrine tumours (PET) occur in 50%-60% of MEN1 patients. They are mostly multiple, recur after surgery and are a cause of syndrome associated death. Gastrinomas are the most common functional PET followed by insulinomas."

Anterior pituitary tumours that fail medical therapy or symptomatic nonfunctional tumours must be considered for trans-spenoidal surgery.\nAs multiglandular disease is present in all cases, total parathyroidectomy, cervical thymectomy or 3 1/2-gland resection leaving behind half of one gland of parathyroid tissue is the preferred procedure. Non functional PETs >1 cm and nonfunctional adrenal tumours > 4cm in size must be operated upon."

A subtotal resection which retains the healthy part of the gland is preferred and prevents long-term dependence on glucocorticoids or mineralocorticoid. The likelihood of developing MTC is 100% for most mutations and hence operative therapy is offered to patients detected by genetic screening. Depending on the mutation detected, risk groups have been defined to determine the appropriate age for thyroidectomy.\nMTC is almost always the first manifestation of the syndrome. MTC occurs early and is most aggressive in MEN2b with lymph node metastasis present in early stages. pHPT is present in 20%-30% of patients with MEN2a. Most patients are asymptomatic with it."

            "explanation": "A normal adrenal gland weighs just 4 g and is situated near the upper poles of the kidneys in the retroperitoneum within Gerota's capsule. The right gland is located between the right lobe of the liver and diaphragm, behind the IVC. The left gland is close to the upper pole of the left kidney and renal pedicle. The adrenals are very vascular organs. The arterial supply shows considerable variation, but it receives blood from the aorta and diaphragmatic and renal arteries. A large adrenal vein drains on the right side into the IVC and on the left side into the renal vein. It is hence difficult to access the left adrenal vein in procedures such as adrenal venous sampling.\nIt has two functional parts, which are the cortex and medulla. Catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine and metanephrines) are secreted by the adrenal medulla. Cells of the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex secrete aldosterone (regulates sodium homeostasis). Cells of the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis synthesize cortisol and adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosteron."

            "explanation": "1. D Addison's disease: Addison's disease is associated with other autoimmune condition such as type 1 DM, vitiligo, etc. Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of primary adrenal failure globally. Hypotension, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and hypoglycaemia are commonly observed. The diagnosis is confirmed by high 9 am ACTH levels (reduced cortisol production causes a negative feedback and rise in ACTH drive by the pituitary) and inability of serum cortisol to elevate following a short synacthen test.\n2. E Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive disorders of steroid synthesis, resulting in decreased cortisol secretion. The age and type of clinical presentation varies widely from neonatal emergencies to young adults presenting with features of androgen excess. Associated mineralocorticoid deficiency is associated with hypotension and sodium wasting.\n3. C Cushing's syndrome: Cushing's syndrome is characterised clinically (Figure 52.2a and b) by weight gain (abdominal obesity), hirsuitism, easy bruising, thin skin, stria, proximal myopathy, glucose intolerance and hypertension. It is due to exogenous steroid usage or related to in vivo production of cortisol. Cortisol excess is diagnosed by the following: â€¢ Elevated morning and midnight plasma cortisol levels, possibly with loss of diurnal rhythm. â€¢ Dexamethasone fails to suppress 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion. â€¢ Serum ACTH levels discriminate ACTH-dependent from ACTH-independent disease treatment is open (Figure 52.2c) or laparoscopic excision.\n4. A Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production: ACTH-dependent cortisol excess might be due to a pituitary disease (associated with a corticotrophin microadenoma) when it is Cushing's disease or related to ectopic ACTH secretion by a variety of tumours (most often small cell carcinoma of the bronchus) Malignancy associated Cushing's presents with pigmentation, weight loss and severe hypokalaemic alkalosis.\n5. B Phaeochromocytoma: Phaeochromocytomas are mostly adrenal in origin (90%). It is often referred to as a â€˜10% tumour' because 10% occur in children, 10% are inherited, 10% are malignant, 10% are extra-adrenal and 10% are bilateral. They present with features of hypertension â€“ headaches, palpitations and episodes of anxiety. A patient presenting with the triad of headaches, palpitations and sweating should arouse the suspicion of a phaeochromocytoma. Excessive metanephrine and normetanephrine in a 24-hour urine specimen is almost diagnostic. The tumour classically shows a â€˜Swiss cheese' configuration. The next step is localisation. A 123|-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) will identify about 90% of primary tumours and is essential for the detection of multiple extra-adrenal tumours and metastases. PET scanning using FDG PET or DOPA PET is yet more sensitive in detecting metastatic foci. Management requires good teamwork between the endocrinologist, anaesthetist and surgeon. Preoperative preparation by a- blockers is essential, with immediate postoperative care being in the ICU. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is now the routine. However, if the tumour is >8 cm or malignancy is suspected, open operation should be carried out."

            "explanation": "1. A Diabetes mellitus: Reactive or prandial hypoglycaemia occurs in diabetes mellitus, alimentary hypoglycaemia and alcohol induced. Symptoms typically occur 2 to 5 hours after a meal and are predominantly of adrenergic origin (anxiety, restlessness, sweating and palpitation). Neuroglycopenic symptoms (dizziness, confusion, paraesthesia, weakness, seizures and coma) rarely occur.\n2. E Disorder of carbohydrate metabolism: Glycogen storage disorders are a group of inherited metabolic disorders associated with fasting hypoglycaemia. It occurs due to the deficiency of enzymes required to break down and use glycogen. The liver and other organs become enlarged with accumulated glycogen. It presents in infancy with fasting hypoglycaemia. Infants and children require constant feeding (approximately once every 2 hours) to prevent hypoglycaemia.\n3. B Hypoglycaemia secondary to oral hypoglycaemic agents: Hypoglycaemia might be associated with increased or inappropriate plasma insulin levels in conditions such as insulinoma, sepsis, drugs such as quinine and pentamidine, overdosage or administration of insulin, or a sulphonylurea (which increase proinsulin release). A urine drug screen can confirm the excess of sulphonylurea within the body.\n4. D Insulinoma: Pancreatic endocrine tumours (PET) account for 5% of all detected pancreatic tumours. They can be benign or malignant, functional or nonfunctional. Insulinomas are the most common PET and represent 70%-80% of all PET's. Insulin-producing tumours cause Whipple's triad, i.e., symptoms of hypoglycaemia after fasting or exercise, plasma glucose <2.8 mmol/L and relief of symptoms on administration of glucose. Being aware of the condition is the secret in suspecting the diagnosis. High secretion of insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide in serial measurements is diagnostic in almost 80%. Once suspected, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) helps in localisation supplemented by intraoperative ultrasound. Treatment is excision or enucleation.\n5. C Insulin overdose: All confirmed hypoglycaemic events must be evaluated in relation to food (fasting or prandial) and presence of detectable insulin or not at the time of hypoglycaemia. Those associated with suppressed insulin levels include hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, chronic renal impairment, liver disease, malnutrition, exercise-induced and drugs such as salicylates and beta blockers."

            "explanation": "1. A Carcinoid syndrome: Carcinoid tumours are neuroendocrine tumours mostly found in the small bowel. The tumours produce serotonin and cause carcinoid syndrome in patients with large liver metastasis or tumour invading the inferior vena cava. The cause of this syndrome is excessive secretion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin). Diagnosis is made by history, examination and assessment of 24-hour urine for 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid (HIAA). Somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy will show tumour deposits in organs, provided they are large enough to have a high burden. The clinical manifestations are protean in nature. They are the following: Vasomotor: Flushing in face and neck and sun-exposed areas Gastrointestinal: Mild to explosive diarrhoea, abdominal pain, bloating and tenesmus Cardiopulmonary: Hypotension during flushing attacks, right-sided heart failure, pulmonary and tricuspid stenosis, bronchospasm Nutritional: Weight loss, features of pellagra: Dementia and skin lesions from niacin deficiency Diagnosis is confirmed by CT scan, which shows multiple liver secondaries. The ideal palliation is hepatic artery chemoembolisation.\n2. E Conn's syndrome: Primary hyperaldosteronism (PHA), or Conn's syndrome, is defined by hypertension, as a result of hyper secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal cortex. Among hypertensives, the incidence of PHA is around 2%. The most frequent cause of PHA with hypokalaemia is a unilateral adrenocortical adenoma. Biochemical diagnosis involves assessment of potassium (low) and aldosterone to rennin ratio (elevated). Once the biochemical diagnosis is confirmed, MRI or CT should be performed to distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease. Selective adrenal vein catheterisation can help to decide on nonsurgical treatment with spironolactone and anti-hypertensives or surgical treatment with unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy in the presence of unilateral disease or subtotal resection in case of a single Conn's adenoma.\n3. B Hyperthyroidism: Graves' disease is an autoimmune condition characterised by hyperthyroidism, pretibial myxoedema and a smooth goitre. Symptoms related to hyperthyroidism include anxiety, sweatiness, diarrhoea and unintended weight loss. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) show a suppressed TSH and elevated fT3 and fT4. The patient will have cardiovascular and neurological features of thyrotoxicosis, with a smooth diffuse goitre (Figure 52.3). The patient is treated by the physician with anti-thyroid drugs over a period of time and closely monitored. In due course a discussion is had with the patient regarding the ideal long-term management among drug therapy, radioactive iodine and surgery. After full-informed consent, the choice is made by the patient with help and advice from the physician and surgeon. If the patient chooses surgery, nowadays the choice is between near-total thyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy whilst a minority of surgeons still may perform subtotal thyroidectomy.\n4. C Metastatic liver disease: A middle-aged person with significant weight loss, cachexia and presence of a palpable mass and liver involvement is strongly suggestive of metastatic bowel cancer. A detailed history and examination is followed by confirming the diagnosis, staging the disease and then instituting definitive treatment after discussion in a multidisciplinary meeting. The diagnosis is confirmed by colonoscopy and biopsy; staging is done by CECT of abdomen and liver US and CXR. Depending upon the staging, the patient would undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy +/â€“ radiotherapy followed by the appropriate surgery to the bowel.\n5. D Phaeochromocytoma: The prevalence of adrenal masses increases with advancing age. Incidentalomas are detected in 1% of patients undergoing imaging. A phaeochromocytoma must be excluded (24-hour urinary catecholamines and metanephrines) and the patient managed appropriately (please see previous section)."
