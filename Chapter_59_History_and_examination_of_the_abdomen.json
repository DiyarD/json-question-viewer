            "explanation": "A major amount of information can be gleaned by observing the patient even before the first question is asked. Initial observations obtained by direct eye contact are important. Looking at the patient while he or she is giving the history will help the clinician to realise whether the patient is any pain. Patients who do not make eye contact might be shy or are not giving the correct history. General appearance of the patient, gait, position in bed, facial expression and tone of speech, provide preliminary information.\nThe patient's presenting complaint gives an idea of the system involved. For example, upper abdominal pain related to food might be connected with pathology in the stomach or gallbladder; altered bowel habit would indicate something wrong with the small and large bowel. Taking past history is very important, particularly if the patient has had an operation before. This might have bearing on the present problem – a recurrence if the operation was for cancer or adhesive obstruction. Toward the end it is essential to do a system review to exclude comorbid disease. Then, summarising the history given by the patient is useful to help the patient recollect anything in the history that he or she might have forgotten.\nRight at the start, it is not a good idea to ask leading questions. This gives the impression to the patient that the surgeon is impatient and interested in only a ‘box-ticking exercise'. The best way to start a clinical interview is to say at the outset ‘Tell me in your own words how it all started' and then look intensely interested with eye contact. The patient realises that the surgeon is a 'listening doctor' and will open up with very useful information. In an emergency, however, if the patient is in severe pain, the clinician might have to resort to leading questions, because the patient might be in far too much pain to volunteer a good history."

            ],
            "explanation": "A hernia causing abdominal symptoms will not always be clinically obvious. This is particularly true when an elderly obese lady presents with features of distal small bowel obstruction from an obstructed femoral hernia, which can easily be missed unless the groins are examined meticulously. When an inebriated patient presents as an emergency with abdominal pain, the diagnosis of alcoholic gastritis should never be made automatically. Although the history might be straightforward in view of his mental status, thorough examination and investigations must be carried out to exclude acute pancreatitis, perforated duodenal ulcer, or acute exacerbation of the same.\nAbdominal pain can well be a clinical manifestation of medical conditions such as right lower lobe pneumonia, angina, porphyria and diabetic ketoacidosis. A history of altered bowel habit with abdominal symptoms indicates an inflammatory (inflammatory bowel disease), infective (parasitic or tuberculosis depending upon the geographical area), or obstructive (large bowel carcinoma) pathology. Upper abdominal pain points to hepatobiliary, pancreatic, or upper gastrointestinal pathology. Painless weight loss associated with anorexia might point to a gastric carcinoma."

                "E Pain away from the site of abdominal pathology denotes referred pain."
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Pain that arises from pathology in the midgut such as small bowel, appendix and right colon is localised in the periumbilical region. Pain in the epigastrium denotes pathology in the foregut such as the stomach and duodenum. The abdominal wall and parietal peritoneum are supplied by somatic nerves, while the autonomic nervous system innervates the abdominal organs and visceral peritoneum. That is the reason for the migration of pain from the periumbilical area in appendicular colic to the right iliac fossa where the pain settles as an ache when the parietal peritoneum is affected.\nPain of autonomic origin is deep and poorly localised. When the pain is transmitted to the appropriate somatic distribution (from T1 to L2), the pain is localised to the surface of the abdominal wall. Such an example is seen in Murphy's sign. Here the pain of acute cholecystitis from the inflamed gallbladder, as it comes into contact with the parietal peritoneum on taking a deep breath, is felt in the right upper quadrant and scapular region in the back.\nColicky abdominal pain is a classical symptom of obstruction of a hollow tube such as the intestines, ureter and common bile duct. In small bowel, because the origin of pain is from pathology in a midgut structure, the colic is central abdominal. The pain comes on as the peristaltic wave tries to overcome the obstruction. Disappearance of the peristaltic wave coincides with the relief of colicky pain that is replaced by a dull ache.\nPain might often be felt at a site well away from the pathology. A perforated hollow viscus such as a duodenal ulcer will cause collection of fluid and air underneath the right dome of diaphragm. This irritates the visceral surface of the diaphragm, which is supplied by the phrenic nerve (principally C4). Hence pain is felt in the right shoulder tip, which has the same segmental nerve supply. This phenomenon is called referred pain."

                "D"
            ],
            "explanation": "General examination of the patient is absolutely essential before abdominal examination, both in the emergency and elective situation. In the emergency, looking at the patient gives the following very important information: apprehensive patient lying motionless is in pain, sweaty patient (in normal room temperature) is in shock, thoracic respiration and immobility of the abdomen denotes peritonitis. In the elective situation the clinician should be aware of the following: weight loss which is apparent if a patient has loose-fitting clothes with holes in the belt having gone up a couple of notches; anaemia when the patient looks pale; and jaundice when there is yellowish discoloration of the skin and conjunctiva. The three features of weight loss, anaemia and jaundice might turn out to be a manifestation of the same condition – disseminated malignancy.\nDiscoloration of the abdominal wall, particularly in an emergency, is very significant – Cullen's and Grey-Turner's signs indicate intra-abdominal bleeding from acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis, leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, or ruptured liver or spleen. Cullen's sign is haemorrhagic discoloration around the umbilicus while Grey-Turner's sign is the same in the right flank (Figure 59.1). One must be aware that in an elective patient hyperpigmentation of the skin may indicate adrenal insufficiency – Addison's disease.\nIn an emergency, a good clinician would ask the patient to take deep breaths in and out before feeling the abdomen. Lack of movement of the abdominal wall on breathing will show that the patient has thoracic respirations, a clear sign of peritonitis; this means that abdominal palpation should be done with the utmost gentleness. To follow on, when it comes to testing for rebound tenderness, a sign of peritonitis, gentle percussion shows finesse on the part of the clinician. Even before this, asking the patient to cough would indicate peritonitis when the patient winces or experiences severe pain.\nExamination of a child with acute abdominal pain (for ease of reading, the male gender is used generically in this paragraph):\nExamining a child with an acute abdomen can be quite a challenge for a clinician not trained in paediatrics. The following technique can be quite useful. After detailed observation of the child, ask the child to put his hand over the sore area. The clinician should then place his hand over the child's hand and continue the palpation using the child's hand with his own. To look for rebound tenderness, coughing is the best way to start. A child with peritonism will not cough. Also to look for rebound, ask the child to press his abdomen and then suddenly ‘let go'. In peritonitis he will wince with pain. The aim should be to elicit rebound tenderness without even feeling the abdomen, or, at the most, very gentle percussion.\nIn the elective patient with an obvious abdominal lump, when the patient tenses the abdomen by the Valsalva manoeuvre or raising the head off the bed, an intra-abdominal lump will become less prominent or disappear depending upon the size. If it becomes prominent, it means that the lump is in the abdominal wall or is a hernia. Palpation of the nine quadrants of the abdomen is carried out in a systematic manner."
