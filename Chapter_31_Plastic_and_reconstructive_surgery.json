            "explanation": "Although polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNL) are important in the early stages of the wound-healing process, healing can nevertheless proceed in the absence of PMNL (and also lymphocytes). However, monocytes are essential for wound healing. Blood monocytes on arriving to the wound site undergo a phenotypic change to become tissue macrophages. Collagen is a rod-shaped molecule composed of three polypeptide chains that form a rigid triple helical structure. About 28 different types of collagen have been described in the human body but the five main types are I-V. Type I collagen is found mainly in bone, skin and tendon, whilst Type III collagen is found mainly in arteries, uterus and bowel wall. The skin nonetheless contains Type III collagen as well, and the normal ratio of Type I to Type III collagen in adult skin is approximately 4:1."

            "explanation": "Healing by primary (first) intention occurs when a wound is closed within 12–24 hours of its creation as in a clean surgical incision or a clean laceration. The wound edges may be approximated directly by sutures, tissue glue, tapes, or staples. Grossly contaminated wounds, wounds with extensive soft tissue loss, or wounds after some surgical procedures (e.g., laparostomy) are left to heal by secondary intention (secondary healing). In this type of healing, the wound closes by wound contraction and epithelialisation. Delayed primary healing is recommended for contaminated or poorly delineated wounds such as bites or abdominal wounds after peritoneal soiling. They are closed after a few days after being left open to prevent infection. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are left unapposed (sutures may be put in place but not tied) and closure is performed after the normal host defences are allowed to debride the wound. Myofibroblasts, having structural properties between those of a fibroblast and a smooth muscle cell, are thought to play a key role in wounds healing by secondary intention. Healing of split-thickness donor graft sites does not occur by secondary intention but by epithelialisation. In this type of injury, since the basal layer of cells remains uninjured, the epithelial cells within the dermal appendages, hair follicles and sebaceous glands replicate to cover the exposed dermis."

            "explanation": "Keloids are dermo-proliferative disorders unique to humans. The aetiology of keloids is unclear, although various theories including familial tendency such as an autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance, hormonal influence, altered immunological response, enhanced role of TGB-β, abnormality of ketatinocyte control over fibroblasts and down-regulation of apoptosis related genes have been purported. Factors such as haematoma, infection and wound dehiscence predispose to hypertrophic scar formation (not keloids). Keloids extend beyond the original scar margins whilst hypertrophic scars are confined to the borders of the original wound. Keloids are more common in wounds that cross tension lines and in areas such as the earlobe, pre-sternal and deltoid regions. They commonly affect children and young adults, and such scars undergo rapid growth during puberty and increase in size during pregnancy. Hypertrophic scars generally develop within weeks of injury, whereas keloids can develop up to one year later. Collagen synthesis is three times higher in keloids than in hypertrophic scars and 20 times higher in keloids than in normal skin."

A skin graft consists of varying amounts of epidermis and dermis. It requires the bed or receiving area to be vascularised, so that ingress of capillaries into the graft can occur and revascularise it. A similar situation exists for successful take of a full-thickness graft or composite graft. The former consists of epidermis and the whole of the dermis from which fat has been removed; the latter is a full-thickness graft that contains hair follicles, cartilage, or other adnexal tissue deliberately taken as part of the complete graft and not secondarily sutured on, e.g., hair transplants or reconstruction of deficient nasal rim."

Gentle handling is important to create the best conditions for take of a full-thickness graft. Grafts do not take on bare tendon or cortical bone, because these do not produce granulations or vascular support.

It relies solely on revascularisation from a healthy, well-vascularised wound bed. Full-thickness skin grafts initially adhere to the recipient bed by fibrin, which must be vascular enough to support the metabolism of the graft; this process is known as imbibition. Within 48 hours, capillaries grow from the underlying bed into the graft, and the graft becomes vascularised. This process is known as inosculation. Since full-thickness skin grafts contain the entire dermis, it shrinks less compared to split-thickness skin grafts. For the same reason (presence of the entire dermis), the texture and pigmentation of full-thickness skin grafts are usually quite similar to normal skin. The donor site of a full-thickness graft is usually closed primarily, whilst the donor site of a split-thickness graft is left to heal by epithelialisation."

Other useful donor sites are the thighs and shaved scalp. It is possible to determine the depth of split skin taken from the bleeding nature of the donor site – larger-spaced punctate bleeding points indicate a thicker graft. Graft take depends on a number of factors, including presence of infection, notably group A beta-haemolytic streptococci, shearing forces and a good blood supply in the recipient area."

Avascular wounds, such as bone without periosteal cover, tendon without paratenon, denuded cartilage, fracture sites and irradiated wounds, are incapable of nourishing a graft. In such instances, a flap is indicated to achieve wound coverage. A flap, by definition, remains attached to the body via a vascular pedicle and thus does not depend on the recipient site for blood or nutrients. Random-pattern flaps rely on random cutaneous vessels for their blood supply. Greater lengths of flap can be used by including the underling deep fascia, by including a perforating blood vessel in the base of the flap, and by ensuring axial blood vessels within the flap itself. Islanding a flap on its vascular pedicle allows even greater pedicle length and thus greater mobility and versatility. When there are no options for local wound cover, tissue in the form of free flap has to be imported from elsewhere in the body. Any tissue that can be isolated on a suitable vascular pedicle can be used, and a free flap might include nerve and bone. Arteries as small as 1 mm diameter can be successfully anastamosed in free-flap surgery."

Inclusion of underlying muscle or fascia with a skin flap increases the flap blood supply if perforators are included. In the design of a transposition flap, it is important to take note of the pivot point as this determines the length of the flap to be used. This point is situated at the base of the flap on the side furthest away from the defect to be covered. The length of this type of flap will be longer than the length of the defect. Usually the donor defect will have to be grafted in part, though in some cases a direct closure might be possible if this is in a very lax area of skin."

The operative time for microsurgical procedures is usually longer than for other types of reconstruction. Careful debridement of the area for reconstruction is essential for success. Donor site morbidity is a recognised disadvantage in free-flap surgery, although this can be minimised with careful pre-operative planning. In breast reconstruction, the latissimus dorsi muscle is usually used as a pedicled flap (blood supply not detached) rather than as a free flap. The commonly used free flap in breast reconstruction is the deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap (DIEP). The other free flaps used in breast reconstruction include thoraco-dorsal artery perforator flap (T-DAP) and the superior and inferior gluteal artery perforator flaps (SGAP and IGAP). The transverse rectus abdominus muscle (TRAM) free-flap surgery that was in vogue about a decade ago has been now superseded by DIEP since it spares the muscle and thus minimises weakness of the anterior abdominal wall."

The technique, if not executed properly, may result in complications such as haematoma under the flaps, wound infection, 'trapdoor' effect and flap necrosis. They have several applications in plastic surgical reconstruction and the theoretical gain in length depends on the angles of the 'Z'. In theory the following will occur:\n• A 30° Z-plasty will provide a 25% gain in length.\n• A 45° Z-plasty will provide a 50% gain in length.\n• A 60° Z-plasty will provide a 75% gain in length.\n• A 75° Z-plasty will provide a 100% gain in length.\n• A 90° Z-plasty will provide a 120% gain in length.\nHowever, these figures are theoretical and the actual gain in length is determined by the amount of laxity of the skin laterally.
