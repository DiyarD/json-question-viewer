            "explanation": "- The diagnostic evaluation of a palpable breast lesion includes physical examination, imaging, and tissue diagnosis.\n- Mammography or ultrasonography can be used for imaging, and pathology can be obtained via fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy.\n- This work-up precludes the need for more invasive incisional or excisional biopsy.\n- If pathology indicates a benign lesion concordant with physical exam and imaging, surgery can be avoided.\n- FNA is the traditional method for cytology, being rapid and safe.\n- Core needle biopsy is increasingly used due to its advantage of providing preoperative knowledge of histology and prognostic factors.\n- Studies comparing FNA with core needle biopsy show core needle biopsy is superior for more conclusive diagnoses for both malignant and benign breast lesions.\n- Core needle biopsy can differentiate between ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive ductal carcinoma, and better distinguish between invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma, which is fundamental for preoperative assessment.\n- MRI is not part of the standard diagnostic evaluation for women with a palpable breast mass and cannot replace tissue confirmation."

            "explanation": "- Nipple discharge is common, occurring in 5% to 10% of women.\n- Physiologic (benign) nipple discharge is bilateral, from multiple ducts, provoked, longstanding or intermittent, milky or dark green, usually due to pregnancy, breastfeeding, medications, or benign hyperplasia; requires no workup beyond history and breast examination.\n- Pathologic nipple discharge is unilateral, from a single duct, spontaneous and persistent, serous (clear, yellow, orange) or bloody, associated with increased risk of underlying disease.\n- Majority of pathologic nipple discharge is caused by papilloma or benign duct ectasia; malignancy is less frequent.\n- For patients with pathologic nipple discharge, after history and physical examination, the standard of care for the next step is mammography and breast ultrasound.\n- Ultrasound is performed even when mammography is normal, to look for abnormalities not seen on mammography.\n- The central question is whether duct excision should be performed in patients with normal physical exam and negative mammogram/ultrasound.\n- Historically, standard approach was duct excision to exclude malignancy.\n- Duct excision has risks (interference with breastfeeding, nipple sensation loss, nipple areolar necrosis).\n- More recent literature suggests additional diagnostics before duct excision.\n- Selection of patients for surgery is determined by additional diagnostic testing.\n- Breast MRI is gradually replacing conventional galactography due to higher diagnostic performance.\n- If breast MRI is normal, short-term monitoring is reasonable.\n- Mammary ductoscopy has been used but has significant limitations (performer dependent, substantial learning curve)."
