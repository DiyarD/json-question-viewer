            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "1. B The glands of the peripheral zone are not lined by transitional epithelium but by columnar epithelium. It is the peripheral zone that is the site where cancer originates and hence prostate carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. In the past, the prostate was described as divided into lobes. Now the prostate gland is considered to consist of a peripheral zone (PZ, 70% of the glandular substance), central zone (CZ, 25%) and transitional zone (TZ, 5%). The CZ is wedge-shaped, forming the base of the gland with its apex at the verumontanum, and surrounds the ejaculatory ducts. The verumontanum is an important anatomical landmark; in transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) all resection must be confined proximal to the verumontanum to prevent incontinence. The TZ lies around the distal part of the pre-prostatic urethra proximal to the apex of the central zone. The zonal anatomy is clinically important in that most cancers arise from the PZ and benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) affects the TZ. The CZ is rarely involved in any disease process. MRI in T2-weighted images can distinguish the zonal anatomy. The PZ and verumontanum have high-signal intensity (looking intensely white), while the CZ and TZ have low signal (looking grey). The rectovesical fascia of Denonvillier's separates the posterior surface of the gland covered by the capsule, bladder base and seminal vesicles from the rectum anteriorly."

            ],
            "explanation": "2. A, B, C, D Testosterone is the main hormone acting on the prostate. This hormone (90%) is secreted by the Leydig cells of the testes under the control of the luteinising hormone (LH) of the anterior pituitary. LH is under the control of hypothalamic luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). The use of LHRH analogues forms the physiological basis of androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer. The enzyme 5α-reductase type II is found abundantly in the prostate. This enzyme converts testosterone into 1,5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is five times as potent as testosterone. The adrenals contribute 5% to 10% of the testosterone output. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is neither specific nor sensitive in diagnosing prostate cancer. Although normal values might vary a little in different laboratories, a value of <3 ng/mL is regarded as normal. Both BPH and prostate cancer might show a PSA in the range of 3 to 15 ng/mL. Almost 25% of men with a PSA of 4–10 ng/mL have prostate cancer (hence not very specific) whilst 15%-20% of men with a prostate cancer have a PSA of 1 to 4 ng/mL (hence not very sensitive). In general, men aged 50–69 years with a PSA of >3 ng/mL would be advised to undergo a prostatic biopsy, although the threshold would be lower in the younger age group with a strong family history of prostate cancer."

            "explanation": "3. A, B, C, E BPH is the most common cause of BOO in men >70 years of age. It is a condition that occurs in men over the age of 50 years; 50% of those >60 years will have histological evidence of BPH. It affects the submucous group of glands and connective-tissue stroma in the TZ; this forms a nodular enlargement which, as it grows, compresses the PZ into a false capsule giving rise to the ‘lateral lobes'. When the condition affects the CZ glands (rarely), a 'middle lobe' forms. When BPH affects two lateral lobes and a middle lobe, an intravesical ‘prostatic collar' forms. With advancing age there is an unequal reduction in the serum testosterone compared with oestrogen levels; thus BPH occurs from increased effects of oestrogen. Anatomically, as the lateral lobes enlarge, the prostatic urethra elongates – the larger the lobes the longer the urethra becomes with exaggeration of the posterior curve. If only one lateral lobe enlarges, distortion of the urethra occurs. In clinical practice this might result in difficulty in passing a Foley catheter should the patient present with acute urinary retention. In that case a curved (coudé) catheter might have to be used. All lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men over the age of 70 years are not always the result of BPH causing BOO. The other conditions that can give rise to LUTS are idiopathic detrusor overactivity or instability, neuropathic bladder and degeneration of bladder smooth muscle with impaired voiding."

            "explanation": "4. A, B, C, D In urodynamic studies a decrease in urinary flow rates is a feature of BPH. For a voided volume of 200 mL or more with a peak flow rate of more than 15 mL/second is normal. A flow of 10–15 mL/second is equivocal and one of < 10mL/second is low. Decreased flow rate is caused by BOO, urethral stricture, or a weak detrusor. Increase in voiding pressures is a feature of BOO. Pressures of <60 cm H₂O are normal; a pressure of >80 cm H₂O is high, and anything in between is equivocal. Increase in voiding pressure with a low flow rate is diagnostic of BOO. Chronic retention is one of the complications of BOO. As a result of inefficient bladder emptying, over a period, urine tends to stagnate in the bladder producing residual urine. If this amount reaches 250 mL, high-pressure chronic retention results; this causes back pressure to the upper urinary tract with bilateral hydronephrosis. Urodynamically proven BOO not only occurs from BPH but also from bladder neck stenosis, bladder neck hypertrophy, prostate cancer, urethral stricture and neuropathic bladder."

            "explanation": "5. D, E In patients with routine symptoms of BPH, the upper urinary tract does not need to be imaged unless infection or haematuria is present. In that case, the upper tract is imaged by US or IVU. Cystourethroscopy is not a good guide as to the indication for surgical intervention. The decision whether to perform prostatectomy is based on the patient's symptoms, signs and investigations. Cystourethroscopy, however, is mandatory immediately prior to a prostatectomy, either open or transurethrally, to make sure there is no incidental intravesical pathology. It also provides information on the size of the intravesical prostate, length of the prostatic urethra and presence of trabeculation, sacculation or unsuspected diverticula. In assessing men with LUTS, the IPSS score and a frequency-volume diary from the patient is very important before the patient attends the clinic to complement clinical examination and relevant investigations. These should include flow-rate measurement studies and pressure-flow urodynamic studies. Transrectal US scanning is not routine unless, on rectal examination, a carcinoma is suspected. Some surgeons do this investigation, nevertheless, for accurate assessment of the size of the prostatic adenoma. Comprehensive assessment of BPH or BOO should include abdominal and rectal examination and neurological examination to exclude multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and spinal-cord compression. Investigations such as serum PSA, serum biochemistry, full blood count and urine culture are done besides urodynamic studies. The importance of thorough assessment prior to surgery cannot be overstated because surgical treatment in the wrong patient will make the patient worse."

These patients with a residual urine of >200 mL have a degree of renal impairment with features of back pressure. Once the renal impairment has been stabilised and the diagnosis confirmed, prostatectomy is carried out. Severe symptoms, as seen from a high IPSS score in the form of poor stream, hesitancy, marked frequency and a feeling of insufficient evacuation, are strong indications for surgery. A maximum flow rate of <10 mL/second and an increasing residual volume (100–250 mL) as seen on repeated US strengthens the case for surgery. Such a picture accounts for 60% of prostatectomies. A period of drug treatment with α-blockers with a combination of α-reductase inhibitors (in those with an adenoma of >50 g), taken for a period of 6 months or so is worthwhile after full discussion between the patient and urologist. Only 25% of fit male patients with acute retention, where no cause for the retention has been found (e.g., constipation, drugs, recent operation) need a prostatectomy. In some patients after initial catheterisation, drug therapy is used for a while followed by trial without catheter. Such management is sometimes successful. The same is true of patients with chronic retention of urine, provided renal function has been stabilised by catheterisation."

E Retrograde ejaculation causing spermaturia occurs in about 65% of patients after prostatectomy because of damage to the internal sphincter, causing disruption of the bladder neck mechanism. This is important to mention when counselling men for TURP. The following two types of drugs are available: α-adrenergic-blocking agents that inhibit the contraction of smooth muscle in the prostate and 5α-reductase inhibitors that inhibit the conversion of testosterone to DHT (the most active form of androgen). α-blockers are more quick-acting, while the 5α-reductase inhibitors need to be taken for a longer period, have fewer side effects and work better in patients with glands >50 g. Drug therapy over 1 year produces a 25% shrinkage of the prostate gland. Drugs result in 20% improvement in symptom scores, while TURP results in 75% improvement."

When serial histological sections of the prostate gland is performed at routine autopsy, foci of cancer can be found although their progression to metastatic disease is uncertain. When prostate cancer occurs in younger men, 10%–15% have a family history. At the operation of prostatectomy for BPH, the prostatic adenoma is removed. This arises from the TZ of the prostate whereas cancer arises from the PZ. Therefore after the operation of 'prostatectomy' for BPH, there is no immunity toward carcinoma of the prostate that can therefore occur. PSA is not a reliable method of screening for prostate cancer. There is no consensus about its use as a screening procedure. Detection of cancer using PSA is 2%–4%. About 30% of men with a raised PSA will have proven prostate cancer. A normal PSA will be found in 20% of men with proven prostate cancer. Population-based screening for prostate cancer is carried out within clinical trials and it remains unclear whether national screening programmes should be established."

            "explanation": "12. D Incidentally discovered disease at TURP (T1a and T1b) for clinically diagnosed BPH is managed by active surveillance with regular digital rectal examination (DRE) and PSA estimation. Radical prostatectomy might be considered in this group in patients below the age of 70 years although some will elect to pursue a conservative approach. Tic tumour, diagnosed after investigations for a raised PSA and T2 tumours (2a is suspicious nodule confined within prostatic capsule in one lobe and 2b involving both lobes) are suitable for radical prostatectomy particularly below the age of 70 years. Radical external-beam radiotherapy (ERBT) is an alternative for early cancer where survival rates is almost similar to radical prostatectomy; in 30% though, persistent tumour is found histologically in treated patients. In T3 disease where the cancer has extended through the capsule, surgery, radiotherapy and androgen ablation or a combination are used. Following radical prostatectomy, carried out by the expert, stress incontinence is <2%."

            "explanation": "1. A Acute prostatitis This young male has features of acute prostatitis where the general features are far more predominant than the local. The findings on rectal examination give the diagnosis. The usual causative organism is E. coli; Staphylococcus aureus and albus, Streptoccocus faecalis, Neisseria gonorrhoea and Chlamydia are also the causative organisms. The seminal vesicles and posterior urethra are also usually affected. This is a clinical diagnosis and must be treated vigorously and over long term. After urine has been sent for culture, the patient must be started on trimethoprim or ciprofloxacin. In due course epidydimo-orchitis might occur. Analgesia on a long-term basis in the form of NSAIDs or stronger might be necessary. Rarely this might proceed on to an abscess when the patient has constant perineal and rectal pain with tenesmus. The prostate will be felt as an enlarged, hot, very tender and fluctuant mass; acute urinary retention might occur when suprapubic catheterisation would be the ideal approach. Under antibiotic cover the abscess should be drained by transurethral resection and unroofing of the cavity. Inadequately treated acute prostatitis might lead to chronic prostatitis, the symptoms of which are sometimes loosely referred to as ‘prostatodynia'. This is a combination of perigenital pain and testicular and perineal pain. Chlamydia might be responsible. The diagnosis can be very difficult to make with certainty. Presence of prostatic threads in the urine is confirmatory. Urethroscopy might reveal inflamed prostatic urethra with an enlarged oedematous verumontanum. Long-term treatment with trimethoprim and metronidazole for 1 week helps when anaerobes are involved. Doxycycline is the antibiotic if Chlamydia is suspected. Pain relief might be such a challenge that a referral to the pain clinic might be warranted.\n4. B Carcinoma of prostate This patient has typical LUTS from BOO of short duration. The findings on rectal examination are very suggestive of a carcinoma of the prostate. The backache also of recent onset might indicate skeletal secondaries. After thorough clinical examination, the diagnosis should be confirmed followed by staging and then instituting definitive treatment. After all blood tests (see above) a trans-rectal ultrasound guided (TRUS) biopsy using an automated gun is carried out. The biopsy is scored according to the Gleason system. An MR cross-sectional imaging, bone scan and CXR are essential in the staging process; x-ray of the pelvis might also be done. Now the patient's management is discussed at the urological multidisciplinary team meeting with a major input from the patient with regard to his wishes. Radical prostatectomy is suitable for T1 and T2 disease and carried out in men with a life expectancy of >10 years. The procedure should be a nerve-sparing operation, the choice of approaches being the traditional open procedure, laparoscopic procedure or robotic procedure depending upon the available expertise. An alternative is radical radiotherapy bearing in mind that in 30% of treated patients persistent tumour is found within the prostate. Brachytherapy is another form of radiation treatment in which radioisotopes iodine-125 and palladium-103 are implanted as seeds directly into the prostate through the transperineal route. In advanced disease the treatment is palliative. Those with BOO undergo TURP (‘channel TURP'), which might need to be repeated. Patients with bone secondaries are offered bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy (or zoladex) + local radiotherapy to the bones.\n2. C Acute retention of urine This patient has acute urinary retention almost certainly precipitated by the use of proprietary cough and flu medicines. Constipation might be a contributory factor too. The patient, who will be in agony, needs strong analgesia followed by immediate decompression of his bladder by the passage of a Foley catheter. Even when urine comes out, the catheter should be pushed further into the bladder before inflating the balloon so as not to inflate the balloon within the prostatic urethra, which might be elongated and distorted. If urethral catheterisation is not successful, suprapubic puncture under local analgesia is carried out using a commercially available pack. Once the urine has been drained into a close system of catheter drainage and the patient is comfortable, a detailed history and examination is undertaken. If the patient did not have any LUTS prior this episode of acute retention, a trial without catheter a few days later is likely to be successful. Some units might give the patient a course of α-adrenergic drugs prior to ‘trial without catheter'. If the patient does not succeed in passing urine, then after urodynamic studies TURP is carried out. Acute retention of urine accounts for 25% of prostatectomies.\n3. D Benign prostatic hypertrophy causing BOO This patient has typical LUTS from BOO due to BPH. These symptoms used to be referred to as prostatism. The patient's symptoms would have been stratified according to the IPSS as mild, moderate and severe before he comes to the outpatient clinic. The patient should be fully examined, although there will be very little to find on clinical examination except for a benign enlarged prostate on rectal examination. A neurological examination is essential. The patient should undergo all of the following routine investigations: urine culture, blood tests including serum biochemistry, PSA and full blood count. Special investigation would be pressure-flow urodynamic studies and imaging of the upper tract if indicated because of infection or haematuria. This is done by ultrasound or IVU. In large benign prostates, the typical appearance is that of ‘fish-hook' deformities of the lower ends of ureters (Figure 77.3). This sort of a picture is an extreme rarity, because IVU is not carried out by most urologists for BOO.\n5. E Chronic urinary retention with overflow This patient has chronic retention with overflow, an aftermath of neglected retention. The patient needs immediate catheterisation. This might result in the following: (i) haematuria as the distended bladder veins collapse as the pressure is released and (ii) post-obstructive diuresis, which needs to be monitored carefully with fluid replacement by intravenous saline. US of the upper urinary tract will show hydronephrosis and hydroureter and serum biochemistry will reveal chronic renal failure with metabolic acidosis. This will take several days to stabilise, during which time the patient's electrolytes are closely monitored. Whilst the patient is being stabilised and his renal failure being brought under control, he should be seen by a neurologist for a thorough neurological examination to exclude neurogenic bladder dysfunction as in multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease or spinal cord abnormalities. In these conditions chronic urinary retention might be an early sign. Once stabilised, the patient might be found to be anaemic. If the haemoglobin is <9 g/L the patient might need blood transfusion. After pressure-flow urodynamic assessment and excluding any neurological problem and uncontrolled diabetes causing neuropathy, this patient will need an operation in the form of TURP, as trial without catheter and medical treatment is highly unlikely to succeed."
