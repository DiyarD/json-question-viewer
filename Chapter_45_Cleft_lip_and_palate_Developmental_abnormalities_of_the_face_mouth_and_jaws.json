            "explanation": "Embryologically, the primary palate consists of all anatomical structures anterior to the incisive foramen. The secondary palate is defined as the part of the palate behind the incisive foramen, which is divided into hard palate anteriorly and soft palate posteriorly.\nThe cleft of the secondary palate does not disrupt a basic growth mechanism of the upper jaw, hence the maxillary complex has normal growth potential. In normal palate, muscles are oriented transversely and meet in midline, while in cleft palate the muscle fibers are oriented in the anteroposterior direction inserting into the posterior edge of hard palate and cleft mucosa.\nBifid uvula and notched posterior hard palate are indications of submucous cleft palate through bifid uvula might be present in 2% of normal population. The levator palatini muscles of both sides form a sling and are mostly responsible for pushing the soft palate backward for velopharyngeal closure during speech (see Figures 45.1 through 45.4)."

Through speech results are better if palate repair is done early, i.e., before beginning of language learning, ideally by 12 months, simultaneous facial growth disturbance because of post-op scarring should also be considered. But speech is the most important goal and should be given priority (see Figures 45.3 and 45.4).\nDissection should be limited to adequate mobilisation of mucoperiosteal flaps to ensure tension-free closure. Freeing up of all the abnormal muscular attachments and achieving an adequate pushback is of utmost importance to have a good speech. The muscle pushback is achieved by the Intravelar veloplasty principle of Sommerlad or the double opposing Z-plasty principle of Furlow.\nCleft palate repair obtains tension-free complete nasal and oral closure from front to back and detachment of abnormal insertions of levator and tensor muscles with re-establishment of muscle sling with adequate pushback of soft palate, which helps in proper speech.\nAdult cases are more problematic because of more bleeding."

When there are combined cleft lip and palates, usually there are two operations, the second being the repair of the hard palate with or without lip revision at 15â€“18 months. A two-stage repair of palatal clefts is sensible as well as being less destructive than a single-stage one. There are several techniques available for cleft repairs, and the Millard methods have become popular in recent years."

Unilateral cleft lip deformity is due to failure of fusion of medial and lateral nasal process, with disruption and abnormal insertion of nasolabial and orbicularis oris on one side. Clefting usually occurs along the phitral ridges. This results in an asymmetrical deformity in form of loss of Cupid's bow, lip vertical height shortening on cleft side, columellar shortening and deformities of external nasal cartilages and nasal septum and premaxilla (see Figures 45.5 through 45.7).\nIn case of incomplete cleft lip, there is a rim of tissue with varying amounts of muscle, on the nasal sill. Bony and muscle anatomical abnormality associated with incomplete cleft lip is similar to a complete cleft but of a lesser degree (see Figures 45.1, 45.2, 45.7 and 45.8).\nBilateral cleft lip is symmetrical clefting along the philtral ridges on both sides extending to the alveolus, resulting in a protruded premaxilla and prolabium, which is devoid of any muscle. In bilateral cleft the deformity is more severe, and the bony, cartilaginous and muscular abnormalities are more profound, which is to be kept in mind during surgical planning."

            "explanation": "In bilateral cleft repair, the severity of deformity must be considered prior to surgical planning. Often lip adhesion and nasoalveolar molding are required to align the severely protruded premaxilla along the lateral alveolar arches, which facilitates the muscular sling reconstruction on later stage. Lip adhesion is done without violating the important anatomical landmarks and might be useful in final definitive repair.\nIn normal palate muscles are oriented transversely and meet in midline, while in cleft palate the muscle fibers are oriented in the anteroposterior direction inserting into the posterior edge of hard palate and cleft mucosa.\nBifid uvula and notched posterior hard palate are indications of submucous cleft palate, though bifid uvula may be present in 2% of normal population. The levator palatini muscles of both sides form a sling and are mostly responsible for pushing the soft palate backward for velopharyngeal closure during speech.\n1. Incomplete cleft lip repair does not require extensive labial muscle exposure\nIn cleft lip repair, the ideal goal is to correct the vertical height discrepancy between the cleft and non-cleft side, approximate cleft edges with recreation of Cupid's bow in balanced position, removal of abnormal muscle and insertion and alignment resulting in pouting of lip, and matching of red line and white line. This is usually achieved by one of the modifications of the rotation advancement technique of Millard, or by one of the variants of the triangular wedge technique.\nIdeally nasal correction should be done along with the primary lip repair achieving a matched alar base and alar flare, equal columella and tip height on both sides. Lip adhesion and naso alveolar molding are more commonly indicated in bilateral cleft lip cases but can be very rarely used for wide unilateral cleft lip defect with significant alveolar arch collapse.\nEven in incomplete cases, full muscular exposure and restoration is required. Anterior palate should be repaired along with lip repair in case of complete clefts. Alveolar bone grafting may be required in later stages."
