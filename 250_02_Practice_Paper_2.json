            "options": [
                "A. Gridiron",
                "B. Lanz",
                "C. Right Kocher's",
                "D. Right paramedian",

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "A Kocher incision is made 3 cm below and parallel to the subcostal margin from the midline to the border of the rectus abdominus muscle. A right-sided Kocher incision is appropriate for an open cholecystectomy. Left-sided incisions are used for splenectomy. The incision cannot be extended medi-ally, and if it is extended too far laterally, many intercostal nerves can be damaged. A rooftop incision (or double Kocher incision) is made up of both a left and a right Kocher incision connected at the middle. It provides good access to the liver and spleen. It is also indicated for use in bilateral adrenal-ectomy, radical pancreatic and gastric surgery.\nThe gridiron and Lanz incisions are used when doing an appendicec-tomy. The gridiron incision is made one-third of the way along, and at right angles to, the line connecting the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus in the right iliac fossa (i.e. McBurney point). A Lanz incision is more transverse in orientation and closer to the anterior superior iliac spine when compared to the gridiron incision, and is made in the skin crease. A Lanz incision is preferred in younger girls as it provides a better cosmetic result. However, these incisions tend to divide the iliohypogas-tric and ilioinguinal nerves resulting in denervation of the muscles of the inguinal canal, increasing the risk of an inguinal hernia.\nParamedian incisions are made 1.5 cm from the midline through the rectus sheath. They have been used as an approach to gross abdominal surgery, in particular to visualize the kidneys and spleen, but are now avoided due to a poor cosmetic outcome.\nEmil Theodore Kocher, Swiss surgeon (1841–1917).\nOtto Lanz, Swiss surgeon (1865–1935)."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Shock is a life-threatening condition in which there is insufficient tis-sue perfusion, leading to inadequate oxygenation of organs. If left untreated, this will result in multi-organ failure and death. The causes of shock may be broadly classified according to their aetiology into hypovolaemic, cardiogenic, anaphylactic, septic and neurogenic. This patient has presented in septic shock, where tissue hypoperfusion occurs secondary to marked systemic vasodilatation, induced by the inflam-matory response. The most common cause of septic shock is endotoxin-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The mainstay of treatment, in addition to supportive measures, is systemic antibiotics. Antihistamines together with steroids and adrenaline are used in the treatment of anaphylac-tic shock, and atropine is used to treat the bradycardia of neurogenic shock. Inotropes increase myocardial contractility and can be used in the treatment of many types of shock including septic and cardiogenic. Intravenous fluids are used to treat the hypotension associated with most types of shock."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "A Mallory-Weiss tear is a superficial mucosal tear. They occur most com-monly at either the gastro-oesophageal junction or gastric cardia. Tears are caused by sudden increases in gastric pressure as occur with retching, repeated vomiting and coughing. Bleeding settles spontaneously within 48 hours in around 90% of cases and the tear heals within a fortnight. Diagnosis is confirmed at endoscopy. The treatment is largely supportive (resuscitation and proton pump inhibitors), unless active bleeding is seen on endoscopy (rare).\nIn contrast to a Mallory-Weiss tear, Boerhaave syndrome is a translu-minal perforation of the oesophagus. Oesophageal varices are a cause of haematemesis in chronic alcohol abuse and develop secondary to portal hypertension caused by liver cirrhosis. Epistaxis is a nose bleed. If large amounts of blood are swallowed during a nose bleed, it may present as bloody vomiting or digested blood in the stools (melaena). Haemoptysis is the term given to blood which is coughed up, the origin of the blood being below the level of the larynx. Causes include pneumonia, pulmo-nary embolism and lung neoplasia.\nVarices can occur in several places in the body, at the points of porto-systemic anastomosis (where the portal venous circulation anastomoses with the systemic venous circulation). All varices have the potential to bleed. The sites of porto-systemic anastomosis are oesophageal, rectal, paraumbilical, retroperitoneal and intrahepatic.\nGeorge Kenneth Mallory, American pathologist (1900–1986).\nSoma Weiss, Hungarian physician (1898–1942)."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Ewing sarcoma is an extremely rare malignant tumour of bone that is most common in the 5-15-year age range. It is a small cell carcinoma that most commonly occurs in the legs or pelvis. Patients present with a painful swelling and fever. X-ray shows a lytic lesion with a laminated periosteal reaction, known as 'onion skinning'. Treatment is by neoad-juvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with surgical excision.\nA chondrosarcoma is a slow-growing malignant tumour of the car-tilage that affects middle-aged patients. X-rays show localized bone destruction with areas of calcification within the tumour. Treatment is by chemotherapy with wide local excision. An osteoid osteoma is a benign, painful, self-limiting tumour of the bone that occurs in children and young adults. It presents with intense pain that is characteristically worse at night and is relieved by NSAIDs. Osteoid osteomas are caused by a nidus of osteoblasts that become trapped in the cortex of the bone. X-rays show a radiolucent nidus surrounded by a dense area of reactive bone. Enchondromas are common benign bone lesions of cartilaginous origin. They develop from aberrant cartilage left within a bone and are usually found in the metaphysis. Enchondromas are usually asymptom-atic and are found incidentally. X-rays show a well-demarcated calcifying lesion within the metaphysis. Enchondromas can be single or multiple (Oilier disease).\nJames Ewing, American pathologist (1866–1943).\nLouis Xavier Edouard Leopold Oilier, French surgeon (1830-1900)."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with the symptoms and signs of small bowel obstruction. Gallstone ileus is a rare cause of small bowel obstruction (5% of cases) but is most common in elderly women. It is not a true ileus in that the obstruction is not a result of bowel dysmotility but a mechanical obstruction caused by an impacted gallstone in the small bowel. Gallstone ileus occurs when a stone erodes through the gall-bladder into the duodenum, forming a cholecysto-duodenal fistula. The most common site of impaction of the stone is at the ileocae-cal junction. Gastric outlet obstruction caused by an impacted gall-stone is known as Bouveret syndrome. Gallstones only usually cause a mechanical obstruction if they are large (>2.5 cm) or multiple. The classical radiological findings of Rigler's triad – small bowel obstruc-tion + pneumobilia (air in the biliary tree, arising from the cholecysto-duodenal fistula) + ectopic gallstones as seen on abdominal X-ray, US or CT – make a definitive diagnosis. Treatment includes resuscitation and urgent surgical removal of the stone (laparotomy). There is a mor-tality rate of up to 20%.\nOther causes of pneumobilia include emphysematous cholecystitis (caused by gas-forming organisms), pyogenic cholecystitis, post-ERCP, postcholecystectomy, blunt abdominal trauma and an incompetent sphincter of Oddi. Pneumobilia is not caused by a perforated gallbladder, though free air under the diaphragm may be seen on the erect chest X-ray.\nLeon Bouveret, French physician (1850–1929).\nLeo George Rigler, American radiologist (1896–1979)."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer) is the most common form of skin can-cer and arises from the basal layer of the epidermis. It typically occurs on sun-exposed areas, although there is also a genetic predisposition to the condition. Various subtypes of basal cell carcinoma exist but the classic appearance is of a 'pearly' lesion with a rolled edge and telangiectasia. Basal cell carcinomas invade locally and rarely metastasize. The majority can be excised but, if too large, can be treated with radiotherapy, and if superfi-cial, by topical chemotherapy (fluorouracil). Overall prognosis is good.\nSeborrhoeic keratoses are common benign tumours also known as senile warts. They are flat pigmented lesions which grow to have a greasy 'stuck-on' appearance. Problems arise if they get stuck to clothes or become infected. The sign of Leser-Trélat is an acute eruption of multiple seborrhoeic keratoses that is associated with an underlying malignancy."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Haemorrhoids are enlarged engorged vascular cushions within the rec-tum. They are common in Western populations and are associated with constipation, obesity and pregnancy. Haemorrhoids may be asymptom-atic or present with a range of symptoms including pruritus, bleeding, soiling, a dragging sensation and pain, particularly if strangulated. They can be seen clearly on proctoscopy and are found at the 3, 7 and 11 o'clock positions with the patient in the lithotomy position. Haemorrhoids are graded as follows:\n1. Do not prolapse\n2. Prolapse on defaecation but spontaneously reduce\n3. Reduce with manual reduction\n4. Cannot be reduced\nThe treatment of minimally symptomatic piles includes stool softeners and a high fibre diet to prevent constipation. Local anaesthetic oint-ments may provide symptomatic relief. Small haemorrhoids (grades 1 and 2) can be treated with sclerotherapy, where an irritant is injected into the submucosa of the piles causing fibrosis and atrophy, or band-ing, where a band applied around the stalk of the pile causes atro-phy and separation. Manual anal dilatation performed under general anaesthesia (Lord stretch) can be used as an adjunct to treatment but is now largely redundant due to the high risk of faecal incontinence. Haemorrhoidectomy is the excision of piles and is used in the treatment of higher grade piles, piles which persistently bleed and in patients with recurrent thrombosis.\nHaemorrhoids, from Greek haima = blood + rhoia = to flow; 'likely to bleed'.\nPiles, from Latin pila = balls."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Carcinoid tumours are tumours of enterochromaffin cells of the ileum that secrete serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT). The 5-HT that these tumours secrete is carried from the bowel, via the portal vein, to the liver where it is harmlessly broken down. However, when carcinoid tumours metastasize to the liver, they can secrete 5-HT directly into the bloodstream, bypassing liver metabolism and resulting in the symptoms described in this question. The presence of carcinoid metastases in the liver that result in symptoms is known as carcinoid syndrome. Features of the carcinoid syndrome include paroxysmal flushing, diarrhoea, bron-chospasm and abdominal pain precipitated by stress, alcohol and caf-feine. The diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome is made by measuring 24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), a breakdown product of serotonin. Management is by resection or, in widespread disease, symp-tomatic treatment with octreotide (a somatostatin analogue that inhibits 5-HT release). Carcinoid tumours are slow-growing so, even if dissemi-nated disease is present, patients can live for many years."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The inguinal canal is 4 cm long and passes downwards and medially from the deep inguinal ring (an inch above the midpoint of the inguinal liga-ment) to the superficial inguinal ring (an inch above the pubic tubercle).\nDirect inguinal hernias protrude straight out of the abdominal wall through a weakened area of the transversalis fascia without travelling down the inguinal canal. The anatomic distinction between direct and indirect inguinal hernias is by their position relative to the inferior epi-gastric arteries. Direct inguinal hernias are found medial to the infe-rior epigastric arteries and indirect inguinal hernias are lateral to them. Direct inguinal hernias pass through Hesselbach's triangle, a landmark bounded by the rectus muscle medially, inferior epigastric vessels later-ally and the inguinal ligament inferiorly. Their position in relation to the inferior epigastric arteries can only really be made at the time of surgery. Direct inguinal hernias are always acquired and are bilateral in 12% of cases. Risk factors include smoking (due to increased coughing caus-ing bouts of high intra-abdominal pressure), obesity, heavy lifting and damage to the ilioinguinal nerve (which contributes to the nerve supply of the anterior abdominal wall and can be damaged by incisions to the lower abdomen, such as those gaining access to the appendix). The neck of direct inguinal hernias is wide and thus rarely strangulates.\nAn indirect hernia is one that travels down the inguinal canal and into the scrotum. Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of her-nias and occur most often in young, active men and premature babies (as the processus vaginalis is more likely to be patent). Indirect inguinal hernias are also more common on the right side, because the right testicle descends later and there is a greater incidence of failed closure of the pro-cessus vaginalis. On examination, the hernia lies above and medial to the pubic tubercle and may be observed to descend into the scrotum on stand-ing or coughing. It does not transilluminate nor is the examiner able to palpate the upper border of the lump.\nThe femoral triangle is found on the upper thigh just below the ingui-nal ligament and contains, from lateral to medial, the femoral nerve, femoral artery and femoral vein (remember ‘NAVY': Nerve, Artery, Vein, Y-fronts). The femoral canal is a space just medial to the femoral vein that contains fat, lymph nodes and vessels. It is in this potential space that femoral hernias can protrude. Femoral hernias are the third most common spontaneous hernia, occurring most frequently in older, mul-tiparous women (this is because the femoral ring is bigger in females and pregnancy stretches the fascia over the femoral canal). They protrude through the narrow femoral ring and into the femoral canal where they expand considerably. On examination, femoral hernias are below and lat-eral to the pubic tubercle and the right side is affected twice as commonly as the left. Because the neck of the femoral ring is narrow there is a high risk of strangulation (50% at 1 month), thus all femoral hernias should be operated on urgently.\nFranz Hesselbach, German surgeon and anatomist (1759–1816)."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "A hydrocele is a collection of serous fluid in the tunica vaginalis, a mem-brane that covers the testis. They can be primary or secondary to an underlying cause. Primary hydroceles (as in this case) are tense, pain-less, fluctuant swellings which transilluminate. They are commoner in boys. Because the fluid surrounds the testicle, the underlying testis is not palpable, however the epididymis above can be felt as a separate struc-ture and you are able to feel the upper border of the swelling (this would not be the case with a hernia). Primary hydroceles are benign but can be surgically excised if desired. (Simple aspiration of the cyst will result in re-accumulation of fluid.) A secondary hydrocele can occur when the membranous sac around the testis becomes filled with exudates secondary to tumours or inflammation of the underlying testis or epididymis. Secondary hydroceles are usually small and lax.\nHydroceles in adults should be investigated with ultrasound to exclude underlying pathology. If no serious pathology is found, treatment can be with scrotal supports, aspiration of fluid or open surgery if there is a large or recurrent hydrocele. Testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis both present with acute testicular pain and marked tenderness on examination.\nThe term varicocele describes varicosities in the pampiniform venous plexus, the network of veins that drains the testicle. It usually occurs on the left side and is present in 10% of males. Patients present with a scrotal swell-ing on standing that feels like a 'bag of worms' and may experience a heavy, dragging sensation. Varicoceles are usually harmless but have been asso-ciated with defective spermatogenesis rendering some patients subfertile (although this is a contentious issue). Varicoceles can be diagnosed by ultra-sound, which shows venous dilatation greater than 2 mm. Management is by reassurance and advising the wearing of supportive underwear. If a patient desires treatment then radiological embolization of the left testicu-lar vein, or ligation and division of the testicular veins, can be performed.\nIn some cases a left-sided varicocele can be indicative of left renal pathology due to impaired venous drainage secondary to a renal mass causing increased backpressure."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Fibroadenomas are common breast lumps that most frequently occur in women aged 15-25 years. They present as discrete, firm, freely mobile lumps, 2-3 cm in size, which classically 'slip' under the examining fin-gers. For this reason, they are also known as ‘breast mice'. Excision of the lesions is not required as there is no risk of malignancy and most resolve over a period of years.\nBreast cysts typically present as a sudden, painful swelling in the breast. They are most common in the forties. Diagnosis and treatment is by aspiration, which reveals a clear fluid. In 30% of cases breast cysts recur these require surgical excision. Occasionally breast cyst aspirate is blood-stained and this is suggestive of malignancy within the wall of the cyst. If this is the case, local excision of the lesion is required.\nBacterial mastitis describes infection of a lactiferous duct by Staphylococcus aureus, which is transmitted by an infant's nasophar-ynx during lactation. It presents with cellulitis around the infected area with pyrexia, tachycardia and a leukocytosis. A complication of bacterial mastitis is the formation of a breast abscess, resulting in a palpable lump. The mainstay of treatment of bacterial mastitis is antibiotics. However if an abscess is present it must be aspirated or drained.\nGynaecomastia is the benign proliferation of male breast tissue due to an imbalance of oestrogens and androgens. It is physiological (normal) in neonates, puberty and in the elderly. There are many other causes of gyn-aecomastia; these include drugs (cimetidine, spironolactone, cannabis, oes-trogen, steroids), renal failure, cirrhosis and testicular tumours. Obesity is not a cause of true gynaecomastia. Although most cases of gynaecomastia resolve spontaneously, excision can be offered if lesions do not settle or are symptomatic or embarrassing. Most commonly, male gynaecomastia can be painful in older men on hormone deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.\nPhyllodes tumours (a.k.a. cystosarcoma phyllodes) are rare tumours of the fibroepithelial stroma of the breast, accounting for <1% of all breast tumours. They are typically benign but fast-growing, and have a distinc-tive leaf-like appearance on histology.\nGynaecomastia, from Latin gynae = woman + mastia = breast.\nPhyllodes, from Greek phullon = leaf; these tumours have a leaf-like appearance on histology."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This child has presented with features of intussusception. Intussusception is a condition in which one part of the bowel (the intussusceptum) invagi-nates into the adjacent distal segment of bowel (the intussuscipiens). Invagination leads to compression of the mesentery with venous engorge-ment leading to oedema and ischaemia which, if left untreated, will result in necrotic bowel, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, perforation, peritonitis, septicaemia and death. The most common site of intussusception is the junction between the terminal ileum and caecum. The cause is unknown in the majority of cases but an increased risk is observed with recent upper respiratory tract infections (believed to be secondary to enlarged lymph nodes), Henoch-Schönlein purpura (purpuric haemorrhages in the bowel provide the focus for an intussusception), Meckel diverticulum and intestinal polyps. Intussusception is most common between the ages of 6 and 9 months and is the leading cause of obstruction in children up to the age of 6 years. It is much more common in boys. Children typi-cally present with paroxysmal episodes of colicky abdominal pain, with drawing up of the legs towards the abdomen. Initially the child is well in between episodes. There may be associated vomiting and diarrhoea, and the passage of 'red-currant jelly' stools (bloody mucus) per rectum occurs late in the condition. A sausage-shaped mass may be palpable in the right upper quadrant. Fever is only present in the presence of necrosis and sep-sis. If the diagnosis of intussusception is suspected then a contrast enema must be performed as soon as possible following resuscitation. A barium enema not only establishes the diagnosis but may successfully reduce the intussusception (in 80%). Recurrence may occur in up to 10%. If there is any indication of perforation or peritonitis, or the enema is unsuccessful, a laparotomy must be performed."

Typical offending organisms are E. coli and Klebsiella. Presentation is with severe colicky right upper quadrant pain, fevers and rigors, and jaundice (Charcot's triad). These three features, along with hypotension and confusion, make up Reynolds' pentad of symptoms. Resuscitation and administration of intravenous antibiotics must be prompt as septicaemia can occur rapidly. Biliary drain-age is also required. Ascending cholangitis has a mortality of at least 5%.\nBiliary colic presents as pain alone without systemic upset or change in blood markers. Treatment is symptomatic and pain usually resolves within 24 hours.\nAcute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder and there are no associated obstructive features. Gallstone ileus is caused by erosion of gall-stones into the duodenum and presents with features of bowel obstruction. It is more common in elderly patients. Carcinoma of the gallbladder is rare, but associated with gallstones in 80% of cases. Its presentation is more insidious and a palpable mass may be found in the right upper quadrant.\nJean-Marie Charcot, French neurologist (1825-1893)."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "De Quervain thyroiditis describes transient inflammation of the thyroid gland associated with viral infection. It is the most common cause of a painful thyroid gland and is typically seen in the younger, female patient. The clinical course of de Quervain thyroiditis is highly variable and in the initial stages there may be features of hyperthyroidism. This usually resolves spontaneously. Following this, there may be a period of hypo-thyroidism, which can become permanent in 10% of cases. Treatment is largely symptomatic, with anti-inflammatories, and thyroid dysfunction can be treated on a short-term basis.\nRiedel thyroiditis is a rare condition in which normal thyroid tissue is replaced by dense fibrous tissue which may extend beyond the gland, causing dysphagia and tracheal compression. Hypothyroidism develops in 30% of cases. Presentation is with a painless 'fixed' goitre and may mimic carcinoma of the thyroid. The diagnosis is confirmed histologically following biopsy. Surgical treatment is required if there are compressive symptoms. A third of patients develop fibrosis at other sites including the lacrimal gland and lung. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune con-dition largely affecting women and caused by circulating autoantibod-ies to peroxidise thyroglobulin. It is a common cause of hypothyroidism although there may be an initial phase of hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland is enlarged, firm and non-tender. Treatment is with levothyroxine. A thyroglossal cyst is a persistence of the thyroglossal duct from the descent of the thyroid at the base of the tongue. These cysts are found in the mid-line of the neck and characteristically move upwards on protrusion of the tongue. Symptoms arise if the cyst enlarges or becomes infected.\nHakari Hashimoto, Japanese surgeon (1881-1934).\nFritz de Quervain, Swiss surgeon (1868–1940).\nBernhard Moritz Riedel, German surgeon (1846–1916)."

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "A perforated peptic ulcer is a life-threatening surgical emergency in which complete erosion of a pre-existing peptic ulcer leads to the spillage of stomach contents into the peritoneum. This causes a chemical peritoni-tis which, if untreated, becomes a bacterial peritonitis. Perforated ulcers are most common in middle-aged men but a larger number of cases are being seen in elderly women secondary to NSAID use. The majority of those who present with perforation would have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease. Most perforations occur in the duodenum; perforation of stomach ulcers is associated with gastric carcinoma in a third of cases. Presentation is much less acute in a posterior gastric ulcer perforation, as spillage is into, and contained within, the lesser sac. Other features of a perforated peptic ulcer are haematemesis and melaena. Endoscopy is contraindicated in the presence of a perforation, however, due to the risk of exacerbating gastric leakage into the peritoneum. Free air is often seen under the diaphragm in an erect chest X-ray, although its absence does not exclude a perforation (free air is not seen in at least 10% of cases). Occasionally, free air not seen on an AP view may be detected on a lateral decubitus film. If perforation is suspected, urgent resuscita-tion of the patient is required, with the administration of intravenous fluids and intravenous proton pump inhibitors, prior to transfer to the-atre. Perforations may become sealed by overlying omentum; these cases may be treated conservatively. The mortality of perforated peptic ulcers increases with age and is up to 10%. Consider testing patients with peptic ulceration for H. pylori infection.\nOther causes of air under the diaphragm, other than the perforation of a hollow viscus, include post-abdominal surgery, lung pathology (e.g. fistulae) and penetrating trauma."

            "options": [],
            "answer": "2400",
            "explanation": "In any adult who is estimated to have 15% of burns or more, and in any child who has 10% or more, it is vital to initiate fluid replacement. Burns result in increased capillary permeability with fluid loss which, with extensive burn areas, can result in hypovolaemic shock. The majority of fluid loss with burns injury occurs in the first 12 hours, but continues for up to 36 hours. Various formulae are used to assess the amount of fluid required for resuscitation.\nOne of the widely used formulas is the Muir and Barclay (a.k.a. Mount Vernon Burns Unit) formula, which states that the amount of fluid to be given in any period (in mL) is calculated as follows:\nFluid per period (mL) = weight (kg) × % burn area/2\nThe periods are as follows:\nEvery 4 hours for the first 12 hours\nthen Every 6 hours for the next 12 hours\nthen Over 12 hours for the next 12 hours\nThus, six volumes are given over the first 36 hours. Note that this is in addition to the patient's normal fluid replacement.\nAs the fluid lost in burns is of a similar composition to plasma, a com-bination of colloid (e.g. Gelofusine) and crystalloid (e.g. Hartmann) would be appropriate. If burns are full thickness, 50% of the fluid should be blood, to replace the red cell destruction that occurs in the burn. Fluid replacement must start from the time the burn occurred, not the time of arrival of the patient – if the above patient arrived in hospital an hour fol-lowing burns injury, the first ration of fluid must be given over 3 hours. Haemodynamic markers and urine output can be used to monitor the response to fluid replacement.\nCalculation: For the first 12 hours (3 periods of 4 hours), the fluid required is (80 kg * 20%) / 2 = 800 mL per 4 hours. Total for 12 hours = 800 mL * 3 = 2400 mL."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient has peptic ulcer disease associated with Helicobacter pylori infection, as determined by a positive urease test (Campylobacter-like organism [CLO] test). Eighty percent of peptic ulcers are associated with H. pylori infection. H. pylori is a Gram-negative, spiral-shaped rod that can colonize gastric-type mucosa, whether that be in the stomach itself or gastric-type metaplasia in the oesophagus or duodenum. Infection is found in 50% of the over-50s, but most people with it are asymptomatic. H. pylori produces urease, an enzyme that converts urea into ammonia. The ammonia it releases neutralizes the acidic pH around it, which is why this bacterium can live in the harsh acidic environment of the stomach. H. pylori damages gastric mucosa by releasing toxic ammonia and cyto-kines as well as by increasing stomach acid secretion by stimulating gas-trin production. The ability of H. pylori to convert urea into ammonia by action of the enzyme urease is the basis of the rapid urease test (or CLO test). Other ways of detecting the presence of H. pylori include the urease breath test and the stool antigen test. The combination of peptic ulceration with concurrent H. pylori infection is an indication for triple therapy: a proton pump inhibitor with clarithromycin and metronidazole. This is usually given for one week. Repeat testing can confirm the eradication of H. pylori. Biopsies can also be taken at the time of endoscopy if gastric ulceration as a consequence of H. pylori is suspected. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the second most common cause of peptic ulceration. They inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting the action of cycle-oxygenase (COX) which is protective of the gastric mucosa. There are two forms of COX: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 has less effect on the gastric mucosa and therefore selective COX2 inhibitors, e.g. celecoxib, carry a smaller risk of peptic ulceration than non-selective COX inhibitors. Notably, however, they may confer an increased risk of myocardial infarction. There is also an association between long-term steroid use and peptic ulceration; therefore in those taking either of these drugs on a regular long-term basis it may be sensible to add a proton pump inhibitor to reduce the risk of ulceration. Ranitidine, a histamine-2 receptor antago-nist, is used for the symptomatic relief of peptic ulceration and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Peptic ulcers are four times more likely to develop in the duodenum than the stomach. All gastric ulcers must be biopsied due to their poten-tial for malignant change (unlike duodenal ulcers)."

Occasionally these lesions bleed or ulcerate. Cavernous haemangiomas eventually regress and disappear spontane-ously, so intervention is only required if lesions persist beyond a few years of age. Cavernous haemangiomas may rarely be associated with throm-bocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia secondary to trapping and destruc-tion of platelets and erythrocytes within the lesions. This is known as Kasabach-Merritt syndrome.\nA deep capillary naevus (or port-wine stain) is a malformation of the capillaries in the deep and superficial dermis. These are congenital mal-formations which can occur anywhere in the body but are most often found unilaterally on the face. Occasionally a port-wine stain is associ-ated with seizures, mental retardation and eye abnormalities (glaucoma, optic atrophy) due to underlying cranial malformations. This is known as Sturge-Weber syndrome and is usually associated with a port-wine stain in the distribution of the ophthalmic or maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve.\nA superficial capillary naevus (or salmon patch) is a small, flat, pink patch of skin with poorly defined borders.

The foreign body is usually found anterior to the middle turbinate. A for-eign body in the nostril can result in chronic inflammation, presenting with a foul-smelling, blood-stained purulent discharge. Complications of intranasal foreign bodies include respiratory compromise, aspiration and localized infection which can potentially spread (e.g. meningitis). Rarely a foreign body may present with myiasis (infestation of tissue with fly larvae - maggots!). It is important therefore to remove intranasal foreign bodies; however this must be done by an experienced clinician as there is risk of causing further mucosal damage and pushing the object further into the nasal passage. Removal must be carried out under appropriate sedation (topical lidocaine) with the child appropriately restrained and with the foreign body under direct visualization. Phenylephrine is often administered intranasally to reduce oedema and bleeding. A variety of techniques may be used to remove objects, including forceps and suction. Attempts can be made to expel the object by pressing on the contralat-eral nostril and asking the child to blow through the nose forcefully.\nNasal packing is used in cases where epistaxis is not controlled by direct pressure and is contraindicated here as it would force the object further into the nose. Cauterization may be chemical (silver nitrate) or electrical and is a treatment option in severe epistaxis."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is caused by ascending infec-tion from the vagina or cervix causing inflammation of the upper repro-ductive tract. It commonly presents in young women and affects 2% of women in their lifetime. PID is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (>80% of cases), but may also be caused iatrogenically, e.g. by insertion of intra-uterine devices and following termination of pregnancy. Presenting features include lower abdominal pain, deepdyspareunia, dysuria and vaginal discharge. Diagnosis is made by taking vaginal and cervical swabs, but treatment with appropriate antibiotics is commenced immedi-ately to reduce the risk of long-term damage. A typical antibiotic regimen includes 2 weeks of ofloxacin (anti-chlamydia and gonorrhoea) and met-ronidazole (anti-anaerobes and protozoa). If there is significant systemic upset, antibiotics are administered intravenously. Approximately 20% of women have recurrence of PID. Complications are largely secondary to adhesions and include ectopic pregnancy and infertility. Some women also develop Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome – right upper quadrant pain caused by inflammation of the connective tissue around the liver by the pelvic infection.\nMittelschmerz is the name given to the lower abdominal pain that occurs during the middle of the menstrual cycle. It corresponds with ovu-lation. Mittelschmerz pains are benign and experienced by at least 20% of women. Treatment is with simple analgesia.\nRemember that in any woman of child-bearing age presenting with abdominal pain, a pregnancy test must be carried out, so as not to miss an ectopic pregnancy.\nChlamydia, from Greek chlamys = cloak (as chlamydia is often 'cloaked', i.e. asymptomatic).\nMittelschmerz, from German mittel = middle + schmerz = pain ('pain that occurs mid-cycle').\nThomas Fitz-Hugh Jr, American physician (1894–1963).\nArthur Curtis, American gynaecologist (1881–1955)."

            "explanation": "A Colles fracture is a fracture of the distal radius within 2.5 cm of the wrist, associated with dorsal displacement and angulation of the distal fragment. Sudeck atrophy is a reflex sympathetic dystrophy that can affect any limb after injury and can occur in up to 30% of people with Colles fracture. It presents with a persistent burning pain associated with red-ness, swelling and warmth of the affected limb, which in the later stages can become pale and atrophied. Due to sympathetic stimulation there may be excessive sweating over this area. Active treatment with physio-therapy is required in the first instance. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of the median nerve at the wrist and causes pain and numbness over the medial three and a half fingers with no skin changes. Compartment syndrome would be a much earlier complication of a frac-ture, usually caused by swelling within a tight plaster cast. Extensor pol-licis longus rupture is caused by repetitive trauma over a bony fragment or by local ischaemia, and would result in the patient not able to lift the thumb when the hand is placed flat on a table. Malunion would result in persistent deformity of the wrist.\nPaul Herman Martin Sudeck, German surgeon (1866–1945).\nAbraham Colles, Irish surgeon (1773–1843)."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Injury to the knee associated with an acute haemarthrosis is typical of a cruciate ligament injury. The knee contains two cruciate ligaments: the anterior, which prevents forward displacement of the tibia relative to the femur; and the posterior, which prevents backward displacement. Their integrity may be investigated using the Lachman test. Here the knee is kept flexed between 20 and 30 degrees and the tibia is pulled forward with the examiner sitting on the patient's foot. Increased movement in the anterior posterior direction (by more than 4 mm) is described as a positive test and is indicative of anterior cruciate ligament dam-age. A variation of this test with the knee flexed to 90 degrees is known as the 'anterior draw test'. The collateral ligaments are assessed with the knee flexed to 30 degrees; valgus and then varus stress is applied to the joint to assess the integrity of the lateral and medial collateral ligaments respectively. Excessive opening up of the joint is seen with collateral ligament injuries. The McMurray test is used to determine meniscal injuries. With the knee flexed to 90 degrees, lateral pressure is applied to the joint and the lower leg is externally rotated. Pain or palpable crepitus is indicative of a lateral meniscal injury. When medial pressure is applied to the joint and the lower leg is internally rotated, pain indicates a medial meniscal injury. The patellar apprehension test is used to assess the 'dislocatability' of the patella by applying pressure to it. The test is positive if the patient feels anxious that the knee cap is 'going to pop out'. The Simmonds (or Thompson) test is used to test the integrity of the Achilles tendon (the patient lies face down on the bed with the feet hanging off the edge – if there is no plantarflexion of the foot when squeezing the calf, then the test is positive for likely Achilles tendon rupture).\nFranklin Adin Simmonds, English orthopaedic surgeon (1911–1983)."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The cause of this patient's respiratory distress is a flail chest. A flail chest is a life-threatening injury caused by high impact trauma resulting in two or more consecutive ribs being broken in two or more places. That seg-ment of the chest wall then moves independently, moving in on inspira-tion and out on expiration – ‘paradoxical motion' (i.e. the opposite of what the remainder of the intact chest wall is doing). Flail chests are almost invariably associated with an underlying pulmonary contusion and there is a risk of pneumothorax from rupture of the pleura by bone ends. This injury is associated with a high mortality. It is important to make the patient comfortable, provide adequate analgesia such as intercostal nerve blocks (to encourage respiratory effort), and provide respiratory support. Depending on the degree of hypoxia, positive pressure ventilation may be required and its use has largely superseded rib fracture fixation. The mortality associated with a flail chest is largely dependent on the degree of the underlying pulmonary contusion.\nNeedle thoracocentesis is performed in the treatment of a tension pneumothorax."

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Herpes simplex keratitis is a common but serious infection of the cornea caused by the herpes simplex virus. It most commonly presents in adult men many years after primary infection with the herpes simplex virus, where the virus lays dormant in the trigeminal nerve. It presents with a painful, watering, light-sensitive red eye and there may be a 'scratchy' sen-sation. The detection of a branch-like lesion – the 'dendritic ulcer' which contains live virus – is pathognomonic of this condition. Herpes simplex keratitis is treated with topical aciclovir until the ulcer has healed. There is a risk of corneal scarring and blindness so this condition warrants urgent ophthalmological assessment. Steroids are contraindicated as immuno-suppression can lead to increased viral replication and the formation of a larger ulcer.\nA corneal abrasion is caused by trauma, e.g. a scratch from a contact lens or foreign body. It presents with pain, photophobia, watering and the sensation of a foreign body in the eye. They are seen clearly after fluores-cein staining. Corneal abrasions generally heal spontaneously within a few days. Topical antibiotics are generally prescribed to prevent concur-rent infection.\nAnterior uveitis (or iritis) presents with acute-onset eye pain, photo-phobia, blurred vision and lacrimation. On examination, there is likely to be circumcorneal redness, a small irregular pupil and decreased visual acuity. A layer of yellow exudate may be seen in the anterior chamber of the eye (hypopyon). In anterior uveitis the eye pain increases as the eyes converge and the pupils constrict. Anterior uveitis occurs in middle-aged and young adults and is associated with HLA-B27 joint problems (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis) and Behçet disease. Treatment is with topical ste-roids and atropine drops (to keep the pupils dilated and prevent adhesions from forming).\nEpiscleritis describes inflammation of the episclera, a thin membrane that covers the sclera. Episcleritis presents with painless reddening of the eye. It is common with autoimmune conditions, such as rheuma-toid arthritis. On examination, dilated blood vessels will be seen only in the superficial layer of the sclera. Steroid eye drops provide symptom-atic relief and aid recovery. Conjunctivitis presents with reddening and inflammation of the eye, along with lacrimation, itching and burning. Conjunctivitis can be allergic, viral or bacterial. Viral conjunctivitis often results in a watery discharge. Bacterial conjunctivitis is associated with a purulent discharge and is commonly caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus species. Many cases resolve spontaneously, but chloram-phenicol eye drops hasten the response. Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune condition where antibodies act against secretory glands of the body resulting in 'dryness', including xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (ocular dryness), together known as the sicca symptoms."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with symptoms suggestive of lung cancer. It is likely that the cause of his hepatomegaly is metastatic spread of the cancer. The majority of malignant tumours of the liver are metastatic (second-ary tumours), spreading from the lung, breast, gastrointestinal tract and prostate. Tumour deposits are often large and multiple giving a 'craggy' liver. Haematological malignancies such as leukaemia may also infiltrate the liver and present with hepatomegaly, although here the liver would be homogenously enlarged.\nHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary malignancy of the liver (90%). The majority of cases arise from a background of liver cir-rhosis (e.g. alcohol, hepatitis B). Other causes include exposure to aflatox-ins (toxins made by the fungus Aspergillus, which is found in soil and in grains) and schistosomiasis. Presentations include jaundice, ascites and nodular, painful hepatomegaly. Hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with the tumour marker alpha-fetoprotein. Diagnosis is easily confirmed with appropriate imaging (ultrasound or CT). The prognosis is poor (aver-age survival being less than 6 months). Curative options include resection of the tumour or a liver transplant.\nBudd-Chiari syndrome is characterized by the triad of abdominal pain, hepatomegaly and ascites caused by venous flow obstruction secondary to thrombosis of the hepatic vein (note: not the hepatic portal vein). Risk factors include thrombophilias, malignancy, trauma and the oral contra-ceptive pill. Diagnosis may be made on Doppler ultrasound scanning and venography. Treatment includes addressing the underlying cause, throm-bolysis and surgery. A Riedel lobe is a tongue-like projection extending from the inferior border of the right side of the liver. It is a normal ana-tomical variant which may be mistaken for a pathologically enlarged liver or renal mass.\nGeorge Budd, English physician (1808–1882).\nHans Chiari, Austrian pathologist (1851–1916).\nBernhard Moritz Carl Ludwig Riedel, German surgeon (1846–1916)."

It presents within the first 24 hours of life with bile-stained vomiting. It has an incidence of 1/6000 and affects males and females alike. There is an association with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Due to intestinal obstruction, the fetus is not able to swallow amniotic fluid, resulting in polyhydramnios. Diagnosis is con-firmed by the presence of a double-bubble sign on the abdominal X-ray. This represents the presence of air in the stomach and proximal duode-num only, and not in the distal intestines. Definitive surgery in the neo-natal period is required (duodeno-duodenostomy).\nCholedochal cysts are a congenital abnormality of the bile ducts and may show a similar bubble appearance on imaging. However they do not result in polyhydramnios. Oesophageal atresia does cause polyhydramnios and presents in the neonatal period with excessive drooling and an inability to swallow. A chest X-ray is the first line of investigation. Renal agenesis (failure of development of the kidneys) results in oligohydramnios (deficiency of amniotic fluid) rather than polyhydramnios."

His pain appears to be typical of renal colic, radiating from back to front; however, beware of making a first diagnosis of renal colic in the elderly, especially in a patient with known atherosclerotic disease. Rupturing abdominal aortic aneurysms can present in the same way. Therefore, as the patient is otherwise stable, it is safer to get a CT of the abdomen which would pick up either pathology instead of wasting time with an intrave-nous urogram. CT-KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) is the gold standard investigation for diagnosing renal stones.\nAn ultrasound is not indicated as he is known to have gallstones; how-ever, the normal inflammatory markers would not suggest cholecystitis.

Urethral strictures are most commonly caused iatrogenically, e.g. during catheterization and instrumentation, but can also be caused by inflammation secondary to infections such as gonorrhoea and nonspecific urethritis. Balanitis xerotica obliterans is a scarring disease of the glans and foreskin which can extend up the urethra and cause troublesome urethral strictures at its advanced stage. Some strictures may be congenital in origin. Urethrography – in which a dye is inserted through the distal end of the meatus – is most useful in diagnosing strictures, as well as determining their length and number. Urinary flow rates will show an obstructive picture but will not necessar-ily be specific to the diagnosis of a stricture. If the stricture has been caus-ing significant obstruction, renal ultrasound scan would show bilateral hydronephrosis, as would an intravenous urogram. The patient would also have a high post-void residual volume due to incomplete bladder emptying. Urethral strictures can be treated by dilatation, urethrotomy (incision made in the stricture), and in severe cases, urethroplasty (com-plete excision and repair of the narrowed urethra, with or without use of a tissue graft). Diversion surgery can also be performed, which would commonly take the form of a suprapubic catheter."

            "explanation": "In general, the spinal cord is made up of three tracts on either side. A use-ful, simplified model of the spinal cord is as follows: the spinothalamic tract makes up the anterior third of the spinal cord and provides pain and temperature fibres to the contralateral side. The corticospinal tract is the middle third of the spinal cord and provides motor fibres to the ipsilat-eral side. Finally, the dorsal columns are found along the posterior length of the spinal cord and provide vibration sense and proprioception to the ipsilateral side.\nThe anterior cord syndrome occurs secondary to a flexion-compression injury. There is loss of neurological function of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord, namely the spinothalamic (pain, temperature) and cor-ticospinal (motor) tracts. There is greater motor loss in the legs than the arms. The anterior cord syndrome has the worst prognosis of all spinal cord lesions.\nCentral cord syndrome is the most common spinal cord lesion. It occurs in older people with cervical spondylosis who sustain a hyperex-tension injury. There is a flaccid weakness of the arms, but motor and sensory fibres to the lower limb are comparatively preserved as these are located more peripherally in the spinal cord. Central cord lesions have a fair prognosis.\nHyperextension injuries can result in loss of dorsal column function (posterior cord syndrome). These injuries are very rare and the motor and sensory function is preserved. Gait is impaired due to impaired proprio-ception. The prognosis of posterior cord lesions is good."

            "explanation": "The history in this scenario is suggestive of mumps orchitis. Mumps orchitis is most common in pre-pubescent boys and occurs in around 20%, 4-7 days after parotitis. Orchitis is unilateral in 70% of cases. Presentation is with testicular pain, scrotal oedema and general sys-temic symptoms, e.g. fever and malaise. The diagnosis can be made on the history and examination alone, although it is important to exclude torsion if the cause is unclear (even if the only means is by scrotal explo-ration). Treatment is supportive and comprises adequate analgesia, bed rest, local ice packs and scrotal support. An associated tense hydrocele (collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis) may need to be drained. Mumps orchitis is complicated by testicular atrophy in at least 50% and bilateral involvement may result in infertility. There is controversy about the association of mumps orchitis with the development of testicular cancer. Other causes of viral orchitis include infectious mononucleosis and varicella. Bacterial orchitis is most common in older males. Causes include sexually transmitted infections (e.g. chlamydia) and urinary sta-sis (as occurs in benign prostatic hypertrophy). Bacterial orchitis usu-ally also involves the epididymis – epididymo-orchitis. Treatment is with appropriate antibiotics (a urine sample and urethral swabs must be taken as indicated)."

Pilonidal sinuses are most common in men. They may also occur in the web spaces of the fingers of barbers and farmers. The sinuses can cause pain and inflammation, and can present acutely as an abscess. Small sinuses may only require antibiotics, whereas larger problematic sinuses can be drained or excised and laid open. If a superimposing abscess has formed this must be drained and left to heal by secondary intention.\nRectal prolapse presents with the sensation of something coming down the back passage on defaecation; in the initial stages it may reduce spon-taneously or with manual pressure. Proctalgia fugax is the name used to describe intermittent short-lasting spasms of rectal pain, which is unre-lated to defaecation and typically worse at night. Examination of the patient is normal. A perianal haematoma occurs acutely when straining at stool and is caused by the rupture of a vein beneath the anal skin. A blu-ish bulge will be seen on examination and evacuation of the haematoma may be required."

There is a risk of stroke of up to 15% a year following TIAs. Modifiable risk factors must be addressed (smoking, hypertension, diabetes) and low dose aspirin commenced. Carotid bruits are not a reliable indicator of the extent of internal carotid stenosis and so need to be formally investigated by Doppler studies. A stenosis of 70–99% is an indication for surgery in this case.\nAny patient presenting with a TIA should be risk stratified using the ABCD2 score as follows:\nA Age >65 (1 point)\nB Blood pressure >140 systolic or >90 diastolic (1 point)\nC Unilateral weakness (2 points), speech disturbance (1 point)\nD Duration >60 minutes (2 points), 10–59 minutes (1 point)\nE Diabetes (1 point)\nOf a total score of 7, patients with a score of 4 or more require admission for inpatient assessment regarding suitability for carotid endarterectomy. Similarly, patients with two or more episodes of TIA in quick succes-sion ('crescendo TIA') also require urgent assessment regardless of their ABCD2 score. The patient in this scenario has an ABCD2 score of 5, and has had two episodes in quick succession, so requires inpatient assess-ment and urgent carotid endarterectomy if suitable."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The biceps muscle has two sites of origin at the shoulder (the long and short head) and inserts into the tuberosity of the radius. Rupture of the biceps most commonly occurs proximally, at the site of origin of the long head, and presents with acute pain and the sensation of a 'snap'. After this, the retracted muscle is seen as a bulge in the upper arm, most obvious on flex-ion of the elbow (the 'Popeye muscle'). Proximal rupture of the biceps is most commonly seen after middle age in those with degenerative changes in the biceps tendon. In the young it is most often associated with weight lifting. Treatment is largely conservative, unless the patient is young and active, as shoulder function is maintained by the short head of the biceps. Distal rupture of the biceps tendon is much rarer (5% of cases) and occurs following flexion against resistance. It presents with acute pain, swelling and bruising of the elbow. The tendon may be palpable in the antecubital fossa. Again it is most common after middle age. Unlike proximal rup-tures, treatment is largely by surgical reattachment to prevent weakness in flexion and supination.\nRupture of the triceps tendon is rare, usually occurring where there is pre-existing weakening. Causes include a fall onto the outstretched arm and pushing weights. Pain is felt acutely at the tip of the elbow, espe-cially on trying to extend the arm, and there will be marked swelling posteriorly. Treatment is largely conservative. The rotator cuff is a ring of muscles and tendons that provide stability to the shoulder girdle. It is made up of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and teres minor. Rotator cuff tears typically occur in older patients fol-lowing trauma and usually involve the supraspinatus tendon. The most common site of the tear is the 'critical zone' of the supraspinatus ten-don, a relatively avascular region near its insertion. Patients present with shoulder tip pain and an inability to abduct the arm. There is localized tenderness at the lateral margin of the acromion. If the arm is abducted to above 90 degrees with assistance then the patient can sustain the abduction by action of the deltoid muscle (the 'abduction paradox'). If the arm is lowered below 90 degrees it suddenly drops (the 'drop arm' sign). Acute calcific tendonitis of the supraspinatus tendon usually occurs in younger women. Deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals on the medial insertion of the supraspinatus tendon results in acute onset severe shoulder pain. The pain is worst on abduction above 120 degrees – this is different to the range of maximal pain in the impingement syndrome (see below). The pain worsens over a few hours and gradually subsides over a few days. In the impingement syndrome (a.k.a. painful arc syndrome) there is pain on arm abduction between 60 and 120 degrees only. The pain is pro-duced by mechanical nipping of a tender structure between the greater tuberosity of the humerus and the acromion process. The primary lesions that give rise to the painful arc syndrome are: incomplete tear of supra-spinatus, chronic supraspinatus tendonitis, subacromial bursitis and a crack fracture of the greater tuberosity."

            "explanation": "Renal colic is a common presenting condition in the emergency depart-ment. There is a lifetime risk of 10% in men (it is three times less common in women) and usually presents between the ages of 20 and 40. Renal colic that presents in the very young or older population is usually the result of a metabolic abnormality. Risk factors for renal colic include a family history (doubles the risk), dehydration, structural renal tract abnormalities and the use of diuretics (particularly thiazides). Particular metabolic abnormalities include increased excretion of calcium, oxalate and uric acid. The presenting symptoms include sudden-onset pain in the loin/lumbar region which radiates anteriorly to the groin and geni-talia, associated with irritative urinary symptoms (frequency, dysuria and haematuria). Nausea and vomiting often occur. Typically the patient moves around, unable to get comfortable. There may be no particular signs on examination. In uncomplicated renal colic the patient will be afebrile. Investigation must include a urine dipstick (85% have micro-scopic haematuria) and bloods for urea and electrolytes. Appropriate imaging includes a KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) X-ray (up to 90% of calculi are visible), ultrasound scanning and an intravenous pyelogram (IVP). IVP used to be the investigation of choice, but due to the risk of anaphylaxis and contrast nephropathy, spiral CT scanning (CT-KUB) without contrast has now become the 'gold standard'. Treatment of renal colic depends on the size of the stone. Small calculi (<5 mm) pass sponta-neously in 90%, medium stones (5–9 mm) in 50% and those greater than 1 cm usually require intervention. Options for stone removal include extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy +/- stent insertion. The most severe complications of renal calculi occur secondary to obstruction, and include renal failure and sepsis. If there is evidence of either an infected or obstructed kidney it is a urological emergency and a cystoscopically placed retrograde ure-teric stent or a percutaneous nephrostomy may be required. Renal cell carcinoma is the most common cancer affecting the kidneys (85%). It typically presents in the fifth decade, the classic triad being haematuria, flank pain and a mass (often late in the disease). The majority of cases are picked up incidentally or on 2-week wait referrals for haematuria. Risk factors include smoking, a family history and von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Treatment of localized disease is with a nephrectomy. The survival in localized disease is 85% at 5 years, decreasing to 10% with metastatic disease. Pyelonephritis is inflammation of the kidney caused by an ascending bacterial urinary tract infection. It is most common in young women. It presents with urinary frequency, dysuria, fever and rig-ors. There is often marked tenderness in the renal angle. Treatment is with antibiotics."

            "explanation": "A history of rapidly progressive dysphagia with weight loss in a patient of this age (60-80 years) suggests a diagnosis of oesophageal carcinoma. Oesophageal carcinomas are mostly of the squamous cell type and risk factors for development include male sex, smoking, achalasia, alcohol use, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's oesophagus, coeliac dis-ease and Chinese ethnicity. Squamous cell carcinomas of the oesophagus occur most frequently in the mid-oesophagus and spread of tumours is to local structures, such as the trachea and recurrent laryngeal nerve (blood metastases occur late). Adenocarcinomas of the oesophagus are much rarer and arise in the lower third of the oesophagus. They are associated with long-standing gastrooesophageal reflux and the development of Barrett's oesophagus (gastric/intestinal metaplasia of the distal oesopha-gus). The diagnosis of oesophageal carcinoma is by endoscopy and biopsy, with a CT scan performed later to stage the disease. A barium swallow will show an irregular filling defect. Treatment is dependent on the size and spread of the tumour. A cura-tive option is oesophagectomy with re-anastomosis of the stomach to the upper oesophagus. Patients with unresectable tumours may be given palliative stenting or radiotherapy to improve dysphagia. Oesophageal tumours have a poor prognosis. Oesophageal candidiasis results from infection of the oesophagus by Candida albicans. It commonly arises in the setting of immunosup-pression (e.g. acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diabetes or ste-roid use) or in those who have recently used antibiotics. Patients often complain of dysphagia, odynophagia and a hoarse voice. Raised white plaques which can be removed by the endoscope are seen on endoscopy. Treatment is with antifungals such as fluconazole. Oesophageal spasm is a disorder of oesophageal motility. It is subdivided into a diffuse type', where contractions are uncoordinated (causing dysphagia and regur-gitation), and a 'nutcracker type', where contractions are coordinated but occur at a higher than normal amplitude (causing odynophagia). Oesophageal spasm is most common in elderly women. Diagnosis is by barium swallow and manometry. Oesophageal webs are thin membranes of tissue which form within the oesophagus (some may be congenital) and cause dysphagia (worse with solids) and reflux. They are most com-mon in Caucasian women. The Plummer-Vinson (or Paterson-Brown-Kelly) syndrome describes the presence of an oesophageal web with chronic iron deficiency anaemia. It is a risk factor for the develop-ment of oesophageal carcinoma. Oesophageal strictures may be benign or malignant. Causes include intraluminal pathology (malignancy, fibrosis secondary to long-standing GORD), extra-luminal pathology (compressive tumours of the bronchus) and abnormalities in peristalsis (oesophageal spasm).\nNorman Rupert Barrett, British surgeon (1903–1979)."

It usually occurs between the ages of 5 and 10 and is five times more common in boys. In 10% of patients the condition is bilateral. Presentation is insidious with hip pain (which may be referred to the groin or knee) and a limp. Examination may reveal a reduced range of movements in all directions of the hip joint, secondary to irritation of the capsule, although internal rotation and abduction are usually more affected. There may be a fixed flexion deformity of the oppo-site leg (to compensate for shortening of the affected leg) and there may be some muscle wasting on the affected side. X-ray will show a collapsed, irregular, sclerotic femoral head (secondary to osteopenia of surround-ing bone) with an increased joint space. MRI may be more sensitive in detecting changes early on in the condition. Treatment depends upon the extent of disease and the amount of femoral head involved. Mild disease may be treated conservatively with bed rest, analgesia and repeat imag-ing to monitor progress. More severe disease may be treated by abduction bracing/splinting or by femoral osteotomy. The prognosis is worse the older the child, in girls and if more than half the femoral head is affected.

Filariasis (a.k.a. elephan-tiasis) is characterized by thickening of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, often of the legs and genitals. It is caused by infection and obstruction of lymph vessels by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti in tropical countries. The infection is transmitted by mosquito bites. Elephantiasis, from the Greek elephantas = elephant; describing the appearance of the limbs in the affected patient."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). GORD arises because of an abnormally low resting tone of the lower oesophageal sphincter, allowing the reflux of gastric contents back into the oesophagus. Symptoms include retrosternal and epigastric burning pain, waterbrash and nocturnal cough. Symptoms are exacer-bated by eating, bending forwards and lying down. GORD is associated with hiatus hernias, smoking, pregnancy and being overweight. Long-standing GORD can lead to oesophagitis, stricture formation, iron defi-ciency anaemia and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus. The diagnosis of reflux can be made by measuring the lower oesophageal pH. A pH probe is inserted into the lower oesophagus and left for 24 hours – if the pH is less than 4 for more than 4 hours then oesophageal reflux is confirmed. Management of reflux can be conservative (weight loss, diet changes, antacids), medical or surgical. Drugs used to manage GORD include proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole. Surgical repair of medically resistant reflux is with Nissen's fundoplication, where the fun-dus of the stomach is wrapped around the lower oesophagus. A barium swallow provides images of the anatomy and function of the upper Gl tract, a chest X-ray may occasionally reveal a hiatus hernia (air-fluid level behind the heart), endoscopy allows direct visualization of the upper Gl tract, and manometry assesses the pressures within the oesophagus.\nRudolph Nissen, German surgeon (1896–1981)."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The ulnar nerve is susceptible to damage in elbow fractures as it runs behind the medial epicondyle. An ulnar nerve lesion at the elbow would result in: wasting of the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum, wast-ing of the small muscles of the hand except the thenar eminence and lat-eral two lumbricals (supplied by the median nerve), and clawing of the ring and little fingers. There will be an inability to abduct and adduct the fingers (caused by paralysis of the interossei), an inability to adduct the thumb (as suggested by Froment sign where one cannot hold a piece of paper in a pinching grip between thumb and index finger), an inability to abduct the little finger (paralysis of hypothenar muscles), and loss of sensation over the ulnar one and a half fingers. With more distal ulnar lesions, the clawing is more marked (the ulnar paradox). This is because the flexor digitorum profundus, which is supplied by the proximal ulnar nerve, is intact in distal lesions, resulting in more flexion of the interpha-langeal joints and an exacerbated flexion deformity. With ulnar lesions at the wrist, sensation is not affected due to sparing of the dorsal cutaneous branch. Wrist drop with lack of sensation over the anatomical snuff box is seen in radial nerve injuries, while wasting of the thenar eminence and inability to abduct the thumb occur in median nerve injuries."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Torsion of the ovary is an unusual but important cause of an acute abdo-men in women. It commonly occurs in young women (70% are under the age of 30) and up to 20% occur during pregnancy. In the majority of cases torsion is associated with an abnormally enlarged ovary (which may be benign or malignant). Other associations include anatomical abnormali-ties, e.g. abnormally long fallopian tubes, and fertility treatment where excessive cyst stimulation causes generalized enlargement of the ovary. Ovarian torsion more frequently occurs on the right side and there may be a history of previous episodes of pain caused by intermittent twisting. Left untreated, a torted ovary will undergo necrosis causing peritonitis (with a risk of reduced future fertility). Diagnosis is largely one of exclu-sion (i.e. excluding appendicitis and ectopic pregnancy). Both ultrasound and CT scanning are useful imaging techniques; however laparoscopy will allow diagnosis and treatment in one procedure. If there are no signs of vascular compromise, peritonitis or malignancy within the ovary, the ovary may be 'untwisted' and fixed (oophoropexy). Otherwise a salpingo-oophorectomy is performed."
