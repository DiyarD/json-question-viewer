            "question": "A 19-year-old, previously healthy woman was injured after being thrown from a horse. Her only identified injury was a comminuted right femur fracture. She underwent internal fixation of her femur fracture 6 hours after admission and received an intraoperative transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells and 4 L of crystalloid. In the postanesthesia care unit she developed progressive respiratory distress manifested by air hunger, tachypnea (32 breaths per minute), tachycardia (142 beats per minute), a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, and a pulse oximeter reading of 82% despite supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal cannula at 12 L/minute. Breath sounds are symmetrical and clear. There is no evidence of effusion by physical examination. Her chest radiograph is shown (figure 1.1). The most likely diagnosis is",

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Acute respiratory distress in the immediate postoperative period has multiple potential etiologies, and the clinical observations and chest radiograph suggest diffuse acute lung injury (ALI).\n- The timing of respiratory distress and diffuse, bilateral infiltrates make pulmonary embolism an unlikely diagnosis.\n- Aspiration of gastric content is a possibility but unlikely to cause immediate air hunger or this degree of hypoxia.\n- Pulmonary contusion, though possible by injury mechanism, is not supported by the radiograph and precipitous onset.\n- The differential diagnosis is most likely either transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).\n- TRALI is a type of ALI occurring within 6 hours of blood product administration, with oxygenation criteria similar to ALI from other causes, and is a diagnosis of exclusion.\n- The syndrome is more common with plasma-rich products (e.g., fresh frozen plasma, platelet packs).\n- TRALI involves activation of neutrophils or monocytes, thought to be caused by antibodies in donor plasma.\n- The patient's symptoms (hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxemia, clear breath sounds, diffuse bilateral infiltrates) align with TRALI based on the comparison table (Table 1.2)."

            "explanation": "- Smaller tubes (28 French) are as effective as larger tubes (36 and 40 French) for evacuating blood and may be less painful.\n- The triangle of safety for tube placement is at the fifth intercostal space, between the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, not the eighth intercostal space.\n- Periprocedural antibiotics do not reduce empyema or pneumonia incidence and are not routinely indicated for traumatic hemothorax.\n- Tube thoracostomy is associated with a 25% complication rate, not 10%.\n- This high complication rate reinforces the concept that chest tube placement should be avoided if less than 300 mL of blood (small hemothorax) is in the pleural space."
