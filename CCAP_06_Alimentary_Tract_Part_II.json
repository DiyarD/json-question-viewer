            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Acute appendicitis can be classified as either complicated or uncomplicated.\n- Nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis with antibiotics may be equivalent or superior to operative management.\n- Patients with uncomplicated appendicitis who undergo nonoperative management with antibiotics have a higher readmission rate within 1 year, primarily for recurrent appendicitis.\n- Recurrence of appendicitis after nonoperative management occurs in up to one-third of patients.\n- Length of hospital stay tends to be slightly longer in the nonoperative group, although overall cost ends up being lower.\n- No difference in minor or major complications or duration of pain is noted between the groups."

            "explanation": "- The use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has recently gained popularity.\n- The only proven benefit of SILS is improved cosmesis.\n- Despite only one incision, there is no decrease in postoperative pain.\n- The return to activity is the same as in traditional laparoscopic techniques.\n- Operating time is longer.\n- The conversion to an open technique is not higher.\n- The one disadvantage of the SILS technique is an increased incisional hernia rate of approximately 8% versus 1% using traditional laparoscopic techniques, likely because SILS incisions use a 2.5- to 3-cm incision versus a 1.0- to 1.5-cm incision.\n- The use of robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques in SILS does not improve the incisional hernia rate, because a larger incision is still used."

            "explanation": "- This patient is healthy with a reliable abdominal exam and localized tenderness without diffuse peritonitis.\n- The most appropriate initial management is bowel rest and antibiotics, even in the presence of free intraperitoneal air.\n- If the patient had signs of uncontrolled sepsis, was immunocompromised, or had an unreliable exam, initial surgical exploration would be warranted.\n- In the absence of diffuse peritonitis, most patients with complicated diverticulitis can be treated successfully with a nonoperative approach combining bowel rest, antibiotics, and percutaneous drainage of abscesses larger than 4 cm.\n- A study found that only 3.7% of patients with perforated diverticulitis with pneumoperitoneum or abscess required initial surgery, with another 5% requiring surgery for failure of nonoperative management.\n- Of 27 patients with free air remote from the site of perforation, 25 (92.5%) were successfully treated without surgery.\n- A study of 8 hemodynamically normal patients with distant pneumoperitoneum had a 100% success rate of nonoperative therapy.\n- This patient does not have a drainable fluid collection, so percutaneous drainage is not warranted. However, up to 40% of these patients will ultimately develop an abscess larger than 4 cm, so percutaneous drainage may become indicated depending on clinical progress.\n- Sigmoid colectomy would be warranted only in uncontrolled intra-abdominal sepsis or failure to improve with nonoperative management.\n- Primary anastomosis is safe in select patients with complicated diverticulitis, with the decision for colostomy versus anastomosis based on intraoperative findings.\n- Colorectal anastomosis is often protected by a diverting loop ileostomy.\n- Laparoscopic lavage and drainage was previously considered a popular alternative but has lost favor due to high rates of morbidity."

It is not appropriate in the setting of an acute abscess and should instead be performed in a delayed fashion after sepsis resolution.\n- Fistula plugs also require sepsis resolution before placement but have reported healing rates of approximately 24%."

            "explanation": "- The modified Johnson classification contains 5 types of peptic ulcers; Type III ulcer is located in the prepyloric area and is associated with high acid levels.\n- Endoscopic hemostatic therapy is indicated to control bleeding, but injection of dilute epinephrine alone is inadequate.\n- A meta-analysis of 16 randomized controlled trials compared injection of diluted epinephrine alone with injection followed by a second modality; combination treatment led to substantial reductions in rate of recurrent bleeding, surgery, and mortality.\n- Other meta-analyses showed that a second modality should be added to injection treatment.\n- Evidenced-based recommendation (2012) from the National Clinical Guideline Centre advises against using adrenaline as monotherapy for endoscopic treatment of nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and recommends mechanical methods, thermal coagulation, or fibrin/thrombin with adrenaline.\n- Surgery is not indicated as the next step in management, because randomized controlled trials show that repeated endoscopic treatment reduces the need for surgery without increasing mortality risk and is associated with fewer complications.\n- Angioembolization is reserved for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding that cannot be managed endoscopically."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- As many as 26% of patients with initial Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) will not respond to conventional antibiotic regimens.\n- Effective treatment strategies for recurrent CDI are challenging.\n- The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American College of Gastroenterology published guidelines on treatment of recurrent cases of CDI, recommending repeated, pulsed, and extended courses of oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin, but this regimen becomes progressively less effective with each recurrence.\n- Recently, fecal transplantation, consisting of enteral or colonic infusion of feces from healthy donors, emerged as an alternative treatment strategy for patients with chronic or recurrent CDI.\n- Multiple studies documented more than 300 patients successfully treated for CDI with fecal transplantation.\n- A New England Journal of Medicine study randomized patients with CDI refractory to vancomycin or metronidazole; 81% of patients treated with infusion of donor feces had resolution of infection.\n- Fecal transplant was a more effective treatment strategy than oral vancomycin or bowel lavage.\n- Probiotics are used to prevent and treat CDI, presumably to repopulate the colonic microflora, but no randomized controlled trials support their use as a treatment of CDI.\n- Subtotal or total colectomy is the recommended surgical approach to fulminant CDI.\n- Loop ileostomy with intraoperative colonic lavage is also described as an option for fulminant CDI. Neither surgical approach is used for recurrent CDI.\n- Antimotility agent loperamide may reduce diarrhea duration but may cause fecal stasis resulting in dangerous progression of CDI, so it is not routinely recommended."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- The incidence of iatrogenic colonic perforation during screening colonoscopy is low (<1%) but is often associated with significant morbidity and possible mortality.\n- Risk factors for perforation include anticoagulation, contamination, malignancy, and use of electrocautery and polypectomy.\n- Therapeutic colonoscopy carries a higher risk of perforation than screening colonoscopy.\n- Immediate identification and repair of perforation is important, as delayed diagnosis can lead to peritonitis, sepsis, and death.\n- Perforations can be managed operatively or nonoperatively, with recent data supporting a minimally invasive approach.\n- Nonoperative management is appropriate when the patient is asymptomatic with free air alone (managed with oral antibiotics, serial abdominal examinations, and bowel rest).\n- Insertion of a presacral drain is not indicated.\n- Placement of a covered stent is also not necessary.\n- Advances in endoscopic technology make endoscopic clip closure an ideal approach for small (<10 mm) colonic perforation during a screening colonoscopy.\n- Intraluminal endoclipping allows repair of small perforations recognized at the time of colonoscopy.\n- Endoscopic repairs should be performed with minimal air insufflation to avoid distention of the lumen and incomplete closure of the defect.\n- Operative management (open or laparoscopic surgery) is indicated in patients with diffuse peritonitis and contamination or in patients who fail nonoperative or endoscopic management.\n- Several surgical options exist, depending on patient's underlying pathology, perforation size, and surgeon's skill level.\n- When done early, primary closure of the perforation with or without resection can be performed given preceding bowel preparation.\n- Colonic diversion is used only when patient is found to have significant peritoneal contamination."
