            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- The preoperative clinical staging for this patient with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is cTlb (tumor size >1 cm < 2 cm limited to the thyroid gland), NO, MO.\n- Although the prognosis for this patient is favorable, the potential for locoregional recurrence serves as the rationale for some surgeons to advocate for routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection (PCLND).\n- The incidence of lymph node micrometastases ranges from 25 to 50%, and subsequent follow-up using thyroglobulin can lead to unnecessary radioiodine therapy if PCLND is not performed.\n- Detractors of routine PCLND in patients with clinically node-negative disease cite that routine PCLND does not alter overall 5-year survival in patients younger than 45 years.\n- Although PCLND for patients with cNO disease remains controversial, it is certainly not contraindicated.\n- The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has determined that a randomized clinical trial to examine the potential benefits of PCLND for patients with cNO disease is not feasible because the morbidity of PCLND is quite low and the large sample size required to power a study to demonstrate significance would be prohibitive.\n- There is no evidence to support a higher risk of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury with routine PCLND.\n- To standardize the definition of the central neck compartment, the ATA defined the boundaries of level VI and VII nodes to be the hyoid bone superiorly, the carotid arteries laterally, the superficial layer of the deep cervical fascia anteriorly, the deep layer of the deep cervical fascia posteriorly, and the innominate artery on the right and its corresponding axial plane on the left inferiorly."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Branchial cleft anomalies (BCAs) represent the second most common congenital neck mass after thyroglossal duct cyst.\n- They can present as cysts, sinuses, or fistulas.\n- They arise from aberrant development or incomplete obliteration of the external clefts and internal pouches that develop from the 6 mesodermal arches that form on the superior-lateral aspect of a fetus during the fourth to seventh weeks of gestation.\n- Each branchial arch, except the fifth, is associated with the development of specific structures of the head and neck.\n- The first arch forms into the middle ear, eustachian tube, and external auditory canal.\n- The second arch develops into the lining of the palatine tonsils.\n- The third arch becomes the inferior parathyroid glands and the thymus.\n- The fourth arch evolves into the superior parathyroid glands and C-cells of the thyroid.\n- BCAs arising from the second arch are the most common, accounting for 70 to 90%.\n- These anomalies can present anywhere along a tract arising from the tonsillar fossa, running by the glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves, coursing between the internal and external carotids, and ending at the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid.\n- They are classified into 4 types, based on whether they lie superficial to, adjacent to, within, or posterior to the carotid sheath, respectively.\n- Second arch BCAs most commonly manifest in the third to fifth decade as cysts, presenting as a nontender, soft mass lying deep to the sternocleidomastoid.\n- Ultrasound imaging reveals a round mass of uniform low echogenicity, no acoustic enhancement, and no internal septations.\n- CT scans and MRI also may be used to delineate the BCA and its course.\n- In adults, fine needle aspiration should be performed to rule out malignancy as the origin of the mass.\n- As with all BCAs, complete surgical excision of the cyst or tract is the therapy of choice."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- The patient presents with classic history and exam for a shoulder syndrome secondary to spinal accessory nerve (SAN; 11th cranial nerve) injury.\n- SAN injury impairs motor function to the trapezius muscle, leading to weakness of shoulder abduction and drooping of the shoulder.\n- Other symptoms and signs include shoulder pain and stiffness and winging of the scapula.\n- The spinal root of the SAN exits the skull through the jugular foramen, pierces the sternocleidomastoid muscle, innervates it, and runs lateral to it, where it is close to the greater auricular nerve (which is a sensory nerve and can serve as a landmark for surgeons to find the SAN).\n- The SAN then runs diagonally through the posterior triangle (level V) with a variable course and ends by innervating the trapezius at that muscle's edge a few fingerbreadths above the clavicle.\n- The extracranial course of the SAN is superficial as it lies between the investing and prevertebral layers of fascia.\n- It is small and interdigitates with nodal tissue, leading to its tendency to be injured.\n- Electromyography can be diagnostic, revealing a spectrum of nerve injury ranging from near complete recordable nerve action potential at one extreme to complete denervation on the other.\n- The patient presented can be evaluated by electromyography, and, if the nerve seems innervated, conservative management with physical therapy can be attempted.\n- Electromyography can be monitored to look for signs of regeneration, which can take up to 18 months.\n- The neck should be explored within 3 to 6 months if the patient shows no improvement on clinical exam and electromyography.\n- In a series of 156 patients who failed conservative management and eventually came to operative repair, most nerve injuries were in the upper portion of the triangle, 29 patients needed neurolysis only, and 123 required nerve repair or grafting; 88% of patients improved with operative intervention.\n- This is a peripheral nerve injury; therefore, ruling out a brain metastasis is unnecessary.\n- The patient has stage T2aN0, IB melanoma.\n- Staging with any imaging modality is not indicated for this low stage.\n- Further, the preferred imaging modality for the brain in melanoma patients is MRI, not CT scan.\n- Such injuries are not uncommon during lymph node biopsy in the posterior triangle (level V) of the neck.\n- Approximately 3 to 10% of all lymph node biopsies in that area result in some SAN injury, which can lead to functional deficit in 60 to 90% of cases if not treated.\n- In a review of malpractice cases for a SAN injury, 95% involved lymph node biopsy in the posterior triangle.\n- In that review, only 46% of cases were decided for the defendant, and the average award was in excess of $500,000.\n- SAN injury cases are considered high-risk litigation."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Most salivary tumors are in the parotid (the largest salivary gland) and most of these are benign.\n- Conversely, minor salivary gland (the smallest salivary glands) tumors are uncommon, and most are malignant.\n- As a rule of thumb, the likelihood of a salivary tumor is directly proportional to the size of the gland of origin, yet the chance that the tumor is malignant is inversely proportional to the size of the gland.\n- Pleomorphic adenomas, the most common parotid tumors, are usually benign, are accurately diagnosed on fine needle aspiration, and have a low chance (3-10%) of harboring occult malignancy on final pathology.\n- Malignant transformation of a pleomorphic adenoma is more likely if the pleomorphic adenoma recurs.\n- The case presented here is classic: benign parotid tumors are usually slowly growing and painless.\n- Fine needle aspiration is highly accurate.\n- In one study, confirmatory core needle biopsy was needed only 21% of the time, even when malignancy was suspected.\n- Superficial parotidectomy without node dissection has a high chance of cure for pleomorphic adenomas and should be accomplished with a low risk of facial nerve injury in experienced hands.\n- Warthin tumors (monomorphic adenomas), the second most common parotid tumors, are more often seen in older patients, men, and smokers, and they are often bilateral."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: A<b><br>- Neck masses in children must be evaluated.\n- The most common midline mass in a child is a thyroglossal duct cyst, which is a remnant from the migration of the thyroid.\n- Other midline masses include dermoids and ectopic thyroid tissue.\n- Ultrasound is commonly used to determine whether the mass is cystic or solid.\n- In the case of a solid midline mass, ectopic thyroid should be considered.\n- Thyroid scan can confirm the diagnosis (figure 5.2).\n- Ectopic thyroid tissue is most common at the base of the tongue, called lingual thyroid tissue, although it may occur anywhere along the migration route of the thyroid anlage.\n- These patients are often hypothyroid; measuring a thyroid stimulating hormone will confirm a hypothyroid state.\n- Malignancy is rare in children and obtaining a fine needle aspiration (FNA) to exclude malignancy is not necessary with a positive thyroid scan.\n- Although FNA can be done, the risk of malignancy is low and such an invasive procedure would not be the next step.\n- Direct laryngoscopy looking for a malignancy would also not be necessary in this child.\n- Calcitonin would be appropriate if a family history of endocrinopathy was established, including medullary thyroid cancer, which is also not present in this case.\n- Ectopic thyroid tissue can be confused with a thyroglossal duct cyst.\n- A Sistrunk procedure is not necessary and would remove the only thyroid tissue the patient may actually have.\n- Management is variable given the rarity of the condition.\n- Treating a hypothyroid state with thyroid replacement is necessary and such replacement is associated with a reduction in mass size.\n- Surgical excision is possible followed by thyroid hormone replacement.\n- When the diagnosis is delayed or diagnostic findings suggest malignancy, excluding thyroid cancer with an FNA is necessary.\n- Treatment would be guided by the FNA findings."

            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: A<b><br>- Patients presenting with penetrating facial trauma must have their wounds examined closely to rule out deeper anatomic structures.\n- Lacerations to the cheek may cause significant injury to the facial nerve, vascular structures, the parotid gland, or the parotid duct (figure 8.1).\n- The parotid gland lies superficial to the posterior portion of the masseter muscle.\n- The parotid duct is also called the Stenson duct.\n- It measures approximately 7 cm long and ascends from the anterior portion of the gland.\n- It passes anteriorly, superficial to the masseter muscle near the transverse facial artery and buccal branch of the facial nerve.\n- Hence, evidence of injury to either the artery or nerve should raise concern for parotid duct injury.\n- Failure to recognize and treat parotid duct injuries at the time of initial presentation may lead to development of sialocele, cutaneous fistula, or a salivary duct cyst.\n- The most common presentation of missed parotid duct injury is wound breakdown and salivary drainage in the early days after injury.\n- Delayed recognition of parotid duct injury is common and frequently leads to complications.\n- Inspect all cheek lacerations for evidence of injury to the gland, duct, nerve, or artery.\n- If a ductal injury is identified, microsurgical repair is the treatment of choice and should be undertaken at the time of initial presentation.\n- Delayed repair makes primary repair extremely challenging and often necessitates drainage through the parotid duct orifice, an oral fistula, or saliva production suppression.\n- Pseudoaneurysms of the facial artery are another complication of missed injury and, similar to sialoceles, present as swelling without erythema or significant inflammation.\n- A superficial wound infection is possible after any laceration closure; however, infections after closure of facial lacerations are not common, occurring in 3% of patients or less.\n- A laceration on the cheek presenting with local inflammatory changes after closure should prompt concern for missed parotid gland or ductal injury.\n- The description of this patient's wound location and severe inflammatory reaction are not consistent with pharyngeal or periodontal abscesses that rarely present with external facial findings."

            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: C<b><br>- Postintubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) remains the most common long-term airway complication after prolonged intubation.\n- PITS is caused by cicatricial healing and fibrosis after an endotracheal tube balloon creates transmural ischemia or necrosis of the trachea.\n- Despite improvements in design of endotracheal and tracheostomy tubes, specifically high-volume, low-pressure cuffs, PITS develop in 1 to 2% of patients after prolonged intubation.\n- Symptoms related to PITS will usually develop within 3 to 6 weeks.\n- Exertional dyspnea begins to occur when the diameter of the trachea is reduced below 10 mm, and wheezing or stridor develops once the airway has a diameter less than 5 mm.\n- For patients with PITS who are not in distress, the optimal management is single-stage tracheal resection and reconstruction.\n- The length of trachea that can be resected safely varies with age and body type, but the amount of resection considered feasible for appropriate reconstruction can involve up to half the length of the trachea.\n- Neck flexion alone is sufficient for most patients having primary repair of PITS to facilitate healing without tension.\n- If additional length is needed, a suprahyoid laryngeal release can provide an additional 1.0 to 1.5 cm.\n- Primary single-stage reconstruction results in good or satisfactory results in 93% of patients.\n- Bronchoscopy with dilation is the initial recommended treatment for acute symptoms of PITS for a patient in respiratory distress.\n- Bronchoscopy can improve symptoms temporarily, but it is not definitive therapy.\n- The transmural nature of the scarring and stenosis explains the limited success of purely endoluminal therapy such as serial dilation and tracheal stents.\n- In addition, tracheal stents can migrate and develop granulation tissue at the end of the stent.\n- Consequently, tracheal stents should be used only in carefully selected patients with PITS who are unfit for surgery or who have a limited life expectancy.\n- Laser ablation can be effective in destroying intraluminal tumors and restoring tracheal patency.\n- However, laser therapy is not effective in treating PITS due to the circumferential, transmural nature of the lesion.\n- Although tracheal transplantation has been attempted in a handful of patients with variable success, it is still considered an experimental treatment."

They drain the floor of the mouth, anterior tongue, anterior mandibular alveolar ridge, and lower lip.\n- Level IB nodes are located in the submandibular region. They drain the oral cavity, anterior nasal cavity, midface, and submandibular gland.\n- Level II nodes are the upper jugular nodes. They are divided into IIA (anterior to spinal accessory nerve) and IIB (posterior to spinal accessory nerve). These nodes provide drainage to oral and nasal cavities, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, and parotid gland.\n- Level III nodes are the mid jugular nodes. They drain the oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx.\n- Level IV nodes are the lower jugular nodes. This nodal basin drains the hypopharynx, thyroid, cervical esophagus, and larynx.\n- Level V nodes are located in the posterior triangle. This group is divided into VA (superior to level of cricoid) and VB (inferior to level of cricoid). This group drains the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and skin and soft tissue of the posterior scalp and neck.\n- Level VI nodes are the pretracheal and paratracheal nodes. They provide drainage to the thyroid gland, glottis and subglottic larynx, apex of the piriform sinus, and cervical esophagus."

            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: E<b><br>- Not all traumatic tracheobronchial injuries require repair.\n- Low-energy, nonpenetrating injuries, in particular, can be managed nonoperatively despite seemingly impressive damage.\n- The diagnosis is suspected by hoarseness, subcutaneous emphysema, and a mechanism that involved the airway system such as a traumatic injury or recent bronchoscopy or even intubation, especially in someone with a stenotic trachea.\n- The diagnosis is confirmed by either rigid or flexible bronchoscopy.\n- Features that favor nonoperative management are injuries that are 4 cm or smaller, involve less than one-third of the circumference of the trachea, have wound edges that are well opposed, and those that do not show significant tracheal tissue loss.\n- Additionally, the patient should be hemodynamically normal, without an associated esophageal injury, and without signs of sepsis.\n- This patient is hemodynamically normal with no other injuries and favorable anatomy.\n- Elective intubation secondary to the tracheobronchial injury is not necessary.\n- If intubation is necessary, care should be taken during intubation so as not to make a partial disruption into a complete one.\n- A nonoperative approach can be used even in patients who require mechanical intubation and would consist of humidified air, voice rest, antibiotics, a proton pump inhibitor, continued observation, and repeat bronchoscopy.\n- A low tidal volume is recommended.\n- There is no role for stenting in these patients.\n- If the patient has difficulty with intubation or mechanical ventilation, then operative management should occur.\n- For patients who require operative repair, most cervical injuries can be managed through a transverse collar incision 2 cm above the sternal notch.\n- The chest should be prepared in case a median sternotomy is required.\n- If the injury is noted to be 2 to 3 cm from the carina, then a right posterolateral thoracotomy through the fourth or fifth intercostal space should be used unless the injury is distal to the carina on the left.\n- In those cases, a left posterolateral thoracotomy should be used through the fifth intercostal space.\n- However, these distal injuries are unlikely in low-energy blunt trauma situations."

            "explanation": "- The parotid gland is the most common site for salivary neoplasms (approximately 85% of cases).\n- Most parotid tumors are benign, and the most common type is the pleomorphic adenoma, also known as benign mixed tumor.\n- Unlike some benign tumors, pleomorphic adenomas tend to recur and undergo malignant transformation (carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma) if inadequately treated.\n- The mainstay of treatment for pleomorphic adenomas Is surgical resection.\n- Tumor enucleation (or lumpectomy) that leaves the tumor capsule in situ is inadequate, with reported recurrence rates as high as 45%.\n- Dissection of the facial nerve with superficial parotidectomy is the traditional management when the tumor is located in the superficial lobe.\n- Total parotidectomy Is used when the tumor is located in the deep lobe.\n- In the current scenario, because the tumor is located in the superficial lobe, superficial parotidectomy is the indicated treatment.\n- Neither modified neck dissection nor adjuvant radiation therapy is necessary in the treatment of pleomorphic adenomas.\n- Although tumor recurrence is greatly reduced with superficial parotidectomy, associated complications such as facial weakness, Frey syndrome, and esthetic hollowing are debilitating.\n- Thus, some head and neck surgeons have championed lesser resections that dissect fewer branches of the facial nerve and leave more parotid tissue.\n- Partial parotidectomy, as opposed to enucleation, appears to be as effective as superficial parotidectomy when performed by expert surgeons in appropriately selected patients."
