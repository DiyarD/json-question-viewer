            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Sedation should be used cautiously. The risk is higher in elderly and those with comorbidities. Pharyngeal anaesthesia may increase the risk of aspiration in sedated patients. The use of supplemental oxygen and pulse oximetry is essential in all sedated patients. A trained assistant should be present to monitor the patient throughout the procedure. Resuscitation equipment and reversal agents must be readily available. Increasingly, nitrous oxide is used for lower gastrointestinal examinations. CO₂ use instead of air for the procedure is known to decrease the need for sedation."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "The majority of the endoscopic procedures are performed safely, without the need for antibiotic prophylaxis. However, certain procedures are associated with significant bacteraemia. The risk of bacteraemia after colonoscopy, diagnostic OGD and ERCP for obstructed CBD are 2% to 4%, 4% and 11%, respectively. In fact, the incidence of bacteraemia can be between 34% and 54% after oesophageal dilatation. Patients with high-risk conditions, such as severe neutropenia, prosthetic heart valves, or a previous history of infective endocarditis, should have prophylaxis for all endoscopic procedures. Patients with moderate-risk conditions, such as mitral valve prolapse with leaflet disease and regurgitation, require antibiotics for procedures, which causes significant bacteraemia. The antibiotic regimen depends on local policies, but a standard protocol is 1 g amoycillin and 120 mg gentamycin IV 5 to 10 minutes prior to the procedure (Teicoplanin 400 mg IV if allergic to pencillin)."

            "explanation": "Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the investigation of choice in patients with persistent obscure gastrointestinal bleeding who have a negative gastroscopy and colonoscopy. In addition to assisting with the diagnosis of Crohn's disease, CE is useful in assessing the extent and in the diagnosis of recurrence following resection. CE may be used in the diagnosis of complications of coeliac disease. The main complication of CE is retention. Hence is contraindicated when obstruction is suspected."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "A diagnostic OGD usually examines up to the second part of the duodenum. The fibreoptic endoscope was the originally used, however, the charge-coupled device (CCD) has been in use since 1960s. The CCD allows the creation of a digital electronic image, which is processed by a computer and transmitted to a TV monitor. The patient needs to stop clopidrogel prior to colonoscopic polypectomy to minimise the risk of bleeding. Although endoscopy is safe, it is still associated with rare but potentially life-threatening complications such as bleeding, perforation, missed lesions, incomplete examination and sedation-related problems. It is hence mandatory to explain clearly the procedure and complications to the patient and obtain a fully informed consent prior to the procedure. Approximately 1% of medical negligence claims in the United States are related to endoscopic procedures."

            "explanation": "1. H Barrett's oesophagus: This is becoming increasingly important, as it is associated with increasing the risk of malignancy. The incidence of adenocarcinoma of the lower end of the oesophagus is increasing. Barrett's oesophagus showing dysplastic changes needs regular surveillance. There is still some debate about its management, but most agree that severe dysplastic changes would be a strong reason for surgery. Invasive carcinoma may be found in almost half of these cases.\n2. G Carcinoma of the oesophagus: This causes profound weight loss and rapidly progressive dysphagia. Staging investigations such as endoscopic US, computerised tomography (CT) scan and laparoscopy are important before embarking on major resections. Prognosis still remains poor.\n3. F Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST): This may be an incidental finding but can cause upper gastrointestinal bleed, which draws attention. Prognosis, though variable, is a lot better than adenocarcinoma. Even advanced cases respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib.\n4. I Hiatus hernia: A small hiatus hernia may be an incidental finding. Some are associated with features of reflux oesophagitis. This can rarely present with complications such as incarceration, necrosis and perforation.\n5. E Linitis plastica: The mucosa may appear deceptively normal (though a bit stretched) and biopsies may be negative because the pathology is submucosal. The stomach will be very contracted and non-distensible. Special biopsy forceps are necessary to get the required tissue. Patients usually present late and hence this carries a very poor prognosis.\n6. C Mallory-Weiss tear: Patients present with severe epigastric pain, retching and mild haematemesis. The clinical differential diagnosis includes duodenal perforation, acute pancreatitis, myocardial infarction and oesophageal perforation. Endoscopy confirms the diagnosis, which is self-limiting.\n7. A Oesophageal varices: This may be seen in patients with portal hypertension presenting with haematemesis. The varices are usually injected or banded. More rarely, embolisation or vasopressin may be used. Surgery is almost never indicated nowadays, except in desperate situations.\n8. B Peptic stricture: This is a complication of long-standing GORD. Barrett's oesophagus may be present. The diagnosis is confirmed on histology, where intestinal metaplasia is seen. Smooth tapering and absence of shouldering differentiate this from malignancy.\n9. J Rectal cancer: Large rectal polyp in an otherwise unfit individual is assessed by taking a detailed history, followed by thorough clinical examination. This is followed by endoscopic assessment and biopsies. If the biopsies show dysplasia, there still may be a focus of cancer. Hence, MRI of pelvis and CT chest abdomen and pelvis are performed. To assess the local T staging, EUS may be beneficial. EUS is used in the lower gastrointestinal tract in the assessment of low rectal polyps to differentiate between T1 and T2 lesions, and in the assessment of perirectal lymph nodes. EUS is also indicated in the assessment of fistula in ano and in assessment of anal sphincter complex in faecal incontinence. However, EUS is an investigation that is operator dependent.\n10. D Reflux gastritis: This is a complication of long-standing GORD. Barrett's oesophagus may be present. The diagnosis is confirmed on histology, where intestinal metaplasia is seen. Smooth tapering and absence of shouldering differentiate this from malignancy."

Procedure-specific complications include bleeding, perforation and infections. Patients on anticoagulants should be assessed for their risk of thromboembolism against the risk of bleeding if a therapeutic procedure is planned. If bleeding is encountered during the procedure, combined modality using adrenaline injection, mechanical methods such as clips and snares and thermal methods such as argon plasma coagulation (APC) are used. Caution should be exercised when using APC, because there is a risk of perforation. Perforation should be suspected following upper gastrointestinal procedure if the patient complains of severe chest pain and has haemodynamic instability. On examination there may be subcutaneous emphysema or peritonitis. Early recognition and treatment is essential to reduce the risk of mortality."
