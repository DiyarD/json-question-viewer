            "question": "A 22-year-old pregnant woman presents after being ejected from a truck at highway speed. She is intubated with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3T, pulse of 120 beats per minute, and blood pressure 105/45 mm Hg. Her fundal height is 6 cm superior to the umbilicus. A fetal heart-rate monitor was placed. Which of the following statements is true?",
            "options": [
                "A. Normal heart rate of her fetus should be 85 to 100 beats per minute",

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- Trauma is the leading cause of nonobstetric mortality for pregnant women, affecting 1 in 12 pregnant women and impacting maternal morbidity and fetal outcome.\n- Diagnosis and management of traumatically injured pregnant patients are generally the same as for nonpregnant patients, with few exceptions.\n- Due to uterine compression of the inferior vena cava, those in advanced stages of pregnancy should be placed in the left lateral decubitus position to relieve compression and improve venous return; right lateral decubitus position has the opposite effect.\n- Although there is concern about teratogenic effects of ionizing radiation, this risk is highest during organogenesis (5-10 weeks gestation).\n- At 20 weeks gestation, the fundal height is palpable at the umbilicus, increasing by 1 cm per week thereafter.\n- For this patient with a fundal height 6 cm superior to the umbilicus, the predicted gestational age would be 26 weeks.\n- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be safe, with a fetal exposure of only 3.5 rads.\n- With advances in neonatal care, the age of viability continues to decline but is usually considered to be more than 23 weeks gestation or a fundal height 3 cm above the umbilicus.\n- Red blood cell mass increases approximately 30%, but blood volume increases 40-50%, resulting in relative anemia of pregnancy.\n- The normal fetal heart rate is 120 to 160 beats per minute.\n- Monitoring fetal heart rate is needed to detect decelerations, tachycardia, bradycardia, or loss of variability, which are associated with adverse fetal outcomes."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Historically, initial evaluation and management of penetrating neck wounds were driven by the presence/absence of hard signs, location, and mechanism of injury.\n- Hard signs of vascular or aerodigestive tract injury (e.g., active bleeding, expanding/pulsatile hematoma, air bubbling in the neck) require urgent operative management via formal neck exploration.\n- Patients with \"soft\" signs (e.g., small, nonexpanding hematoma, hoarseness, odynophagia) can be selectively evaluated and managed.\n- In hemodynamically normal patients with only soft signs, multidetector CT angiogram is an excellent screening tool with high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (>90%), especially for vascular injuries.\n- CT scan is a screening exam; any concerns for aerodigestive tract injury after CT scan should be specifically evaluated.\n- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy could be indicated based on CT scan findings but is not the next step in this situation.\n- Local wound exploration without imaging is contraindicated due to risks of bleeding and airway loss if an occult major arterial injury is present.\n- Catheter-based angiography would be used if a specific vascular injury amenable to endovascular treatment was identified, but not as a screening tool.\n- Formal neck exploration in patients with only soft signs is nontherapeutic in up to 80%.\n- For this patient with normal vital signs and a small, stable hematoma, CT angiogram is the best next step.\n- Traditionally, initial evaluation and management of penetrating neck injuries were based on zones (I: manubrium to cricoid, II: cricoid to angle of the mandible, III: above angle of the mandible).\n- This zone-based approach had challenges, especially for gunshot wounds which may traverse several zones.\n- Another approach suggests evaluation guided by symptoms and clinical findings, not zone of injury.\n- Patients with hard signs of injury should undergo operative management; Zone III injuries may be approached by endovascular techniques.\n- Patients with soft signs should have screening CT angiogram as first investigation.\n- Asymptomatic patients with normal exams can be managed expectantly."

            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: D<b><br>- Traumatic colon injuries are classified as nondestructive (amenable to primary repair) or destructive (requiring resection).\n- This patient has a destructive injury (loss of >50% of colon circumference), so resection is required; primary repair would likely result in narrowing or stricture.\n- After segmental resection, the decision for reconstruction (diversion, anastomosis, or anastomosis with diversion) depends on hemodynamic status and overall burden of injury.\n- In this patient with a normal primary survey, normal vital signs, minimal blood loss, and no other major injuries, anastomosis after resection is the next step.\n- In this situation, the leak rate is less than 10%.\n- End colostomy (with or without mucus fistula) would require another laparotomy and is unnecessary.\n- Damage control surgery and a second look are not required in an uncomplicated pre- and intraoperative course."

            "explanation": "- Pancreatic and pancreaticoduodenal injuries are challenging and require an organized and systematic approach.\n- Mortality rates are 12-18% and are higher for blunt trauma compared with penetrating trauma.\n- Shock on admission is the strongest predictor of mortality for patients with operative pancreas injuries.\n- Injuries to the body are easier to address and have lower mortality than injuries to the head of the pancreas.\n- The number of intra- and extra-abdominal injuries does not influence mortality, although associated vascular injuries and increasing age increase risk of mortality."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Splenic injury ranges from small to moderate lacerations or subcapsular hematomas (grades I-III).\n- In hemodynamically normal patients, these injuries can often be successfully treated nonoperatively (bed rest, hemodynamic and laboratory monitoring).\n- More significant lacerations involving segmental or hilar vessels producing devascularization (>25% of spleen, grade IV) or a completely shattered spleen (grade V) are more often treated with splenectomy.\n- However, grade IV and V injuries in hemodynamically normal patients can be managed with nonoperative management, with or without arterial embolization.\n- Routine selective arterial embolization is associated with lower failure rates of nonoperative management in grade IV and V injuries.\n- Risk factors with strong evidence for failure of nonoperative management include age older than 40, grade III or higher injury, or injury severity scores of at least 25.\n- Moderate evidence exists for intraparenchymal contrast blush or transfusion of more than 1 unit of blood being risk factors.\n- No evidence for failure of nonoperative management exists for hemodynamic status on admission, emergency department mean blood pressure, hemoglobin, hematocrit level, or heart rate."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Hemorrhage results in nearly 50,000 deaths and 2 million years of life lost annually in the United States.\n- Blood product resuscitation is essential for the survival of patients in hemorrhagic shock.\n- Empiric resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) together with both plasma and platelets is the optimal initial management for acutely bleeding patients in hemorrhagic shock.\n- PRBCs do not contain clotting factors or platelets and should not be used in isolation.\n- Waiting for laboratory tests before initiating blood product resuscitation is unnecessary and potentially harmful.\n- Plasma and platelets should be given concurrently with PRBCs to avoid significant \"imbalances\" in the ratio of blood products."

            "explanation": "- This patient has signs and symptoms consistent with obstructive shock from pericardial tamponade (diaphoresis, lethargy, tachycardia, narrowed pulse pressure, tachypnea).\n- No pneumothorax is seen on chest x-ray; therefore, a left chest tube is not specifically required.\n- The cardiac silhouette suggests acute pericardial effusion if present, as the pericardium has not had time to expand.\n- FAST exam is grossly positive in the pericardial window (97% specific for cardiac laceration).\n- No further diagnostic measures (e.g., pericardial window, chest CT scan) or temporizing therapeutic interventions (i.e., pericardiocentesis) are needed if surgical capability for pericardial decompression and cardiac repair is immediately available.\n- The diagnostic accuracy of pericardial FAST is degraded in patients with hemothorax or if adequate views cannot be obtained.\n- If fluid is visualized in a patient with clinical tamponade, further evaluation is not needed.\n- In equivocal cases, gated cardiac CT scan, pericardiocentesis, or pericardial window can guide further therapy.\n- If a pericardial effusion is identified and surgical resources are not available, temporizing pericardiocentesis can buy time until transport to a center with surgical resources."

            "explanation": "- Pelvic injuries from high-energy trauma are frequently associated with concomitant internal injuries, including hemorrhage, intra-abdominal injuries, bladder/urethral injuries, and nerve deficits.\n- After considering airway, breathing, and circulation, initial inspection for pelvic injury concern should include: search for external bleeding, blood at penile meatus/vagina, and position of lower extremities/iliac crests.\n- A common classification system for pelvic fractures is the Young-Burgess classification.\n- After initial evaluation, in hemodynamically normal patients, a CT scan with intravenous contrast of the abdomen and pelvis should be obtained.\n- If there is no evidence of active bleeding, patients who continue to be hemodynamically normal should be treated with pelvic stabilization.\n- As long as they remain hemodynamically normal, these patients do not require angiographic embolization, exploratory laparotomy, external pelvic fixation, or pneumatic antishock garments."

            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: B<b><br>- This patient presents in extremis after a gunshot wound in the \"cardiac box.\"\n- A focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam demonstrates a hemopericardium, leading to a diagnosis of pericardial tamponade, which is consistent with the clinical picture.\n- This patient has a penetrating cardiac injury that needs to be addressed immediately to prevent complete cardiac arrest.\n- A left anterolateral thoracotomy will allow for rapid and adequate exposure of the heart and pericardium to allow decompression and repair of any injury.\n- A median sternotomy provides excellent exposure for this kind of injury but requires equipment that may not be immediately available and takes longer to perform than a thoracotomy.\n- A pericardiocentesis in this scenario will result in an excessive amount of time lost; moreover, it is diagnostic only and still requires an urgent operation to fix the cardiac injury.\n- Similarly, a pericardial window is a reasonable diagnostic procedure if the patient already had a laparotomy ongoing and there is suspicion for pericardial tamponade. In this scenario, the diagnosis is clear, and diagnostic procedures will delay definitive management and potentially lead to patient mortality.\n- Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) involves access through a patient's femoral artery and placement of an occlusive balloon in the aorta to stem bleeding distal to the occlusion.\n- Chest trauma that could result in aortic or cardiac injury is a contraindication for the use of REBOA because it may exacerbate the injury."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Severe knee pain, edema, and lack of fracture raise the possibility of significant ligamentous instability and a history of knee dislocation.\n- Knee dislocations are notorious for causing popliteal artery injuries, which need to be ruled out early to prevent irreversible vascular compromise.\n- Palpable pulses indicate distal perfusion is maintained and no acute ischemia is present; however, they do not exclude clinically significant popliteal injury.\n- Measurement of compartment pressures is relevant when there is high suspicion for leg compartment syndrome (e.g., high-grade tibial fractures).\n- Elevated compartment pressures indicate early fasciotomies.\n- Continuous measurement of compartment pressures will not help diagnose popliteal vascular injury.\n- A vascular duplex study can identify flow-limiting lesions.\n- Obtaining the study 24 hours after admission is too late and may result in significant ischemia if injury is missed.\n- The ankle-brachial index (ABI) is an important part of the physical examination in patients with knee dislocations.\n- Abnormal ABI values (<0.9) help identify vascular injury and can obviate routine angiography in all patients with a history of knee dislocations and ligamentous injury.\n- Angiogram is the gold-standard for peripheral vascular injury but is invasive and involves nephrotoxic contrast agents.\n- In patients with palpable pulses and no hard or soft signs of vascular compromise, obtaining an ABI before committing to angiographic imaging is prudent.\n- Routine surgical exploration of patients with knee dislocations is not indicated when there is no evidence of impending vascular compromise."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Hypothermia (<35°C) is an independent predictor of mortality.\n- Hypothermia after traumatic injury results from blood loss and is compounded by a cold external environment and treatment phases.\n- Warming the local environment (trauma bay/OR) helps prevent further heat loss but will not correct hypothermia.\n- Warm insulating blankets and warming gown devices help prevent further heat loss.\n- Correcting blood loss with transfusion and stopping bleeding will correct hypothermia.\n- Peritoneal lavage with warm saline and airway rewarming will not sufficiently increase core temperature to treat hypothermia.\n- Transfused blood products should be warmed to a normal body temperature before transfusion.\n- Transfusing cold products decreases core temperature.\n- Packed red blood cells are usually refrigerated at 20-25°C, fresh frozen plasma at 0-5°C.\n- Rapid transfusers can heat to 37°C and transfuse a whole unit within minutes.\n- Rewarming is imperative in traumatically injured patients."
