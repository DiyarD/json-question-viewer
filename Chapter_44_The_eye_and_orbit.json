It most often arises in the choroid, and the prognosis is less good for choroid lesions than for the iris. Treatment by brachytherapy or proton-beam irradiation can be performed to preserve the eye, but enucleation is needed in some cases. The most common site of metastasis is the liver."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "There is a high likelihood of the presence of a metallic intraocular foreign body in this circumstance. Even very small radio-opaque foreign bodies might be demonstrated with a plain x-ray or CT scan. Ultrasound examination can be done very gently, but there is a risk of causing further injury by pressing on the eye. MRI scanning is absolutely contraindicated, as magnetic force will cause movement of an intraocular ferrous foreign body, with further injury."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "A large volume of saline should be used to irrigate the eye, until all traces of alkaline chemical have been removed. Alkaline substances are much more damaging than other chemicals, as they denature proteins and penetrate deeply into the tissue."
