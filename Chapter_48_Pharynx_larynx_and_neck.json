            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The nasopharynx lies anterior to the first cervical vertebra and has the openings of the Eustachian tubes in its lateral wall, behind which lie the pharyngeal recesses, the fossae of Rosenmüller. The adenoids are situated submucosally at the junction of the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx.\nThe oropharynx extends from the anterior tonsillar pillar to the posterior pharyngeal wall from the level of the hard palate to the level of the hyoid. The oropharynx contains the palatine tonsils, base of tongue, soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall. The palatine tonsils are part of Waldeyer's ring, a complete ring of lymphoid tissue, together with the adenoids and lingual tonsils on the posterior third of the tongue.\nThe laryngeal inlet forms the superior boundary of the hypopharynx. Its inferior border is the lower border of the cricoid cartilage where it continues into the oesophagus. The hypopharynx is commonly divided into three areas – the paired pyriform fossae, posterior pharyngeal wall and post-cricoid area. The mucosa of these areas is, however, continuous so disease processes, such as squamous carcinoma, can easily involve more than one area and might also spread submucosally."

The base is situated at the skull base and the apex is at the greater cornu of the hyoid bone. The medial wall is formed by the visceral layer of the deep layer of deep cervical fascia, which overlies the lateral pharyngeal wall. The lateral wall is the superficial layer of deep cervical fascia, and fascia overlying the mandible, the medial pterygoid muscle and parotid gland. It contains the carotid vessels, internal jugular vein, deep cervical lymph nodes, the last four cranial nerves and the cervical sympathetic trunk. Dental and tonsil infections might track through this space to the superior mediastinum. Patients with parapharyngeal space infection present with trismus due to inflammation and spasm of the medial pterygoid muscle and drooling and hold their head in a slightly flexed position."

            "explanation": "The cricoid cartilage is the only complete ring in the entire airway and bounds the subglottis. This is the most common site for stenosis from prolonged endotracheal tube intubation.\nThe sensory nerve supply to the larynx above the vocal folds is from the superior laryngeal nerve and below the vocal folds is from the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Both these nerves are branches of the vagus nerve (X). The motor nerve supply to the larynx is from the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is a branch of the vagus nerve and supplies all intrinsic muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid is the only abductor the vocal folds. All other intrinsic muscles adduct the cords. As the recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, damage to this nerve or to the vagus nerve will cause paralysis of the vocal fold resulting in hoarseness. Damage to the superior laryngeal nerve, which runs close to the superior pole of the thyroid, will cause a change in voice, which may only be detectable whilst singing.\nThe primary function of the larynx is to protect the lower respiratory tract. The larynx is well developed for phonation in the human and also helps control pressure during the respiratory cycle."

It is often associated with hypertrophy of the other lymphoid tissues of Waldeyer's ring. If excessive hypertrophy causes blockage of the nasopharynx in association with tonsil hypertrophy, the upper airway might become compromised during sleep causing obstructive sleep apnoea. Adenoid tissue can be removed alone or in conjunction with a tonsillectomy.\nThe indications for adenoidectomy are the following:\n• Obstructive sleep apnoea associated with post-nasal obstruction\n• Post-nasal discharge\n• Recurrent acute otitis media or prolonged serous otitis media, usually longer than\n3 months' duration\n• Recurrent rhinosinusitis"

            ],
            "explanation": "Nasopharyngeal carcinomas are usually squamous cell carcinomas. The aetiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is multifactorial. Genetic susceptibility is a factor and certain HLA subtypes e.g., HLA-A2, Epstein-Barr virus infection and consumption of salted fish, are known to be risk factors. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has a bimodal distribution with an increased incidence in young adults and then again in the 50–60 age group.\nClinical presentation includes early lymph node metastases (70%), in particular, retropharyngeal nodes and cervical lymphadenopathy in levels 2 or 5. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a neck node showing undifferentiated carcinoma requires immediate thorough examination of the nasopharynx. Symptoms related to primary disease include nasal discharge, obstruction and epistaxis, which occurs in one-third of patients. Aural symptoms of unilateral deafness as a consequence of Eustachian tube obstruction and secretory otitis media occur in approximately 20% In around 5% of patients, the nasopharynx might look normal or minimally asymmetrical but contains submucosal nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A biopsy of the nasopharynx is essential if there is suspicion of nasopharyngeal malignancy.\nThe primary treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiotherapy, as the majority of the tumours are radiosensitive undifferentiated squamous cell carcinomas. Elective bilateral radiotherapy is given at the skull base and neck in all patients, even when no neck nodes are apparent, as rates of occult metastasis are high. Platinum-based chemotherapy may be given in both the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting, particularly in high-risk cases. Due to the proximity of vital structures in the immediate vicinity of the nasopharynx, surgery is complex and often impossible. Recurrent neck disease may be an indication for neck dissection, but recurrent disease at the primary site is very challenging surgically. Although there is experience with nasopharyngectomy in the Far East, few centres in Europe or North America have significant experience of these techniques. For early disease, 3-year disease-free survival rates of more than 75% are common; however, in advanced disease the results are less good, with 3-year disease-free survival rates of 30%-50%."

            ],
            "explanation": "Peritonsillar abscess or quinsy describes the formation of pus in the peritonsillar space. Patients experience severe pain and trismus due to inflammation around the pterygoid muscles. The tonsil and uvular are pushed medially. Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids and analgesia should be commenced; however, transoral incision and drainage of the pus should be carried out under local anaesthesia.\nThe retropharyngeal space is a potential space that lies posterior to the pharynx, bounded anteriorly by the posterior pharyngeal wall and its covering buccopharyngeal fascia and posteriorly by the cervical vertebrae. It contains the retropharyngeal lymph nodes. These nodes are more developed in young children, and it is at this age that they are most likely to be involved in inflammatory processes, which, if severe, might affect swallowing and the airway as a result of swelling and suppuration of the retropharyngeal space. A retropharyngeal abscess is associated with infection of the tonsil, oropharynx, or nasopharynx. Signs and symptoms include airway compromise, dysphagia, torticollis, stiff neck and swelling of the midline of the posterior pharyngeal wall. Operative approaches to a retropharyngeal space abscess include peroral or an external approach, and a decision on approach will be based on imaging findings.\nChronic retropharyngeal abscess is now rare and most commonly the result of an extension of tuberculosis of the cervical spine, which has spread through the anterior longitudinal ligament to reach the retropharyngeal space (Table 48.1).\nInfectious mononucleosis (or glandular fever) is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. It is common in teenagers and young adults. Signs and symptoms are similar as for bacterial tonsillitis; however, the tonsils are typically erythematous with a creamy grey exudate and cervical or generalised lymphadenopathy is present. Occasionally, hepatosplenomegaly occurs. The diagnosis is confirmed by serological testing showing a positive Paul-Bunnell test, an absolute and relative lymphocytosis and presence of atypical monocytes in the peripheral blood."

            "explanation": "A pharyngeal pouch is a protrusion of mucosa through Killian's dehiscence, a weak area of the posterior pharyngeal wall between the oblique fibres of the thyropharyngeus and the transverse fibres of cricopharyngeus at the lower end of the inferior constrictor muscle. (Figure 48.1). It is thought to be in part due to a hyperactive upper oesophageal sphincter, and is more common in men over 60 years old.\nPatients might experience regurgitation of undigested food, sometimes hours after a meal, and halitosis. Occasionally, they might present with recurrent, unexplained chest infections as a result of aspiration of the contents of the pouch. As the pouch increases in size, the patients might notice gurgling noises from the neck on swallowing and the pouch may become large enough to form a visible swelling in the neck. Surgery is indicated when the symptoms are affecting the patient's quality of life, in particular, weight loss and recurrent pulmonary complications due to aspiration. A barium swallow demonstrates the pouch position and size.\nEndoscopic stapling has superseded the open approach, however, both are still performed. The endoscopic technique is associated with a high symptomatic success rate, decreased operating time and length of stay and lower rates of complications such as wound infection, mediastinitis, pharyngeal fistula formation, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and stenosis of the upper oesophagus."

            "explanation": "Cigarette smoking and consumption of alcohol are significant risk factors for squamous carcinomas of the oropharynx. Cervical lymph node metastases are common due to the extensive lymphatic drainage of the oropharynx. They might be the only presenting feature with an apparent occult primary tumour. Often, the primary is from the tonsil or tongue base but undetectable. Early-stage tumours are usually treated with radiotherapy, although with improvements in surgical access provided by transoral laser and robotic techniques, surgical excision is gaining popularity. Recurrent disease following radiotherapy is usually managed surgically, and reconstruction of the oropharynx might require regionally-based myocutaneous or microvascular free flaps with microvascular anastomosis.\nHodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma commonly present as lymph node enlargement in the neck. Hodgkin's disease is rare in the oropharynx, but non-Hodgkin's lymphoma accounts for 15%-20% of tumours at this site. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for localised non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and might give control rates as high as 75% at 5 years. For disseminated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, systemic chemotherapy is preferred."

They tend to occur in children and singers, and are the result of vocal abuse. Primary treatment is speech therapy. Occasionally, the nodules will need to be surgically removed using microlaryngeal surgery.\nVocal cord paralysis may be unilateral or bilateral. A unilateral left vocal fold palsy is the most common because of the long intrathoracic course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, which arches around the aorta, and a bronchial malignancy should be suspected. A CT scan of the skull base to diaphragm should be performed to image the nerve's course.\nSquamous carcinoma is the most common malignant tumour, and it is responsible for more than 90% of tumours within the larynx. Patients almost always present with hoarseness. In early-stage disease, e.g., confined to one vocal fold; treatment with radiotherapy or carbon dioxide laser excision is associated with a 5-year disease-free survival of more than 90%. Both modalities give comparable quality of voice outcomes.\nSupraglottic and glottic tumours, stages I and II, are optimally treated with radiotherapy or trans oral laser resection, with the aim of preservation of function. Advanced-stage laryngeal carcinomas (stage III/IV) might betreated with chemoradiotherapy for organ preservation or surgery. Decisions relating to the choice of therapy include the degree of cartilage invasion and safety of the airway."

            "explanation": "A branchial cyst is thought to develop from the embryological remnants of the second branchial cleft. Such cysts are lined by stratified squamous epithelium and contain thick, turbid fluid full of cholesterol crystals. The cyst usually presents in the upper neck in early or middle adulthood and is found at the junction of the upper third and middle third of the sternomastoid muscle at its anterior border. If the cyst becomes infected, it becomes erythematous and tender. Ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration aid diagnosis, and treatment is by complete excision, which is best undertaken when infection has settled. In older patients with cystic neck masses, malignancy with a cystic neck metastasis should be considered. Primary disease in the oropharynx is the most common cause.\nA branchial fistula might be unilateral or bilateral and is thought to represent a persistent second branchial cleft and pouch. The external opening is nearly always situated in the lower third of the neck near the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, while the internal opening is usually located in the tonsillar region. Excision involves removing an ellipse of skin around the tract and dissecting it out in a cephalad direction. Further stepladder incisions might be required.\nCystic hygromas (lymphatic malformations) usually present in the neonate or in early infancy. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other neck swellings is that it is brilliantly translucent. They tend to grow steadily with the child and can lead to disfigurement and airway obstruction and require a tracheostomy. Investigation will outline the anatomy and consistency of the cyst. The cyst might become infected. Definitive treatment is complete excision of the cyst, where possible. Injection of a sclerosing agent, for example, picibanil (OK-432), might also be an option, although in cases where multiple cysts are present, both surgery and sclerosing therapy are challenging.\nThyroglossal duct cysts are an embryological remnant of the thyroglossal duct and might occur anywhere in, or adjacent to, the midline from the tongue base to the thyroid isthmus. Rarely, a thyroglossal cyst might contain the only functioning thyroid tissue in the body. Classically, the cyst moves upward on swallowing and with tongue protrusion, due to its attachment to the hyoid bone. Thyroglossal cysts might become infected and rupture onto the skin of the neck, presenting as a discharging sinus. Treatment is excision of the tract with a core of tissue and middle third of the hyoid bone to remove the embryological tract that resulted in the cyst. This operation is known as Sistrunk's operation and reduces recurrence in comparison with excising the cyst alone."

            "explanation": "This is a rare tumour (paraganglioma) that has a higher incidence in areas where people live at high altitudes because of chronic hypoxia leading to carotid body hyperplasia. Approximately 10% of patients have a family history, and there is an association with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A and 2B. There is often a long history of a slowly enlarging, painless lump at the carotid bifurcation. Approximately one-third of patients will present with a pharyngeal mass that pushes the tonsil medially and anteriorly. The mass is firm, rubbery, pulsatile, mobile from side to side but not up and down and can sometimes be emptied by firm pressure, after which it slowly refills in a pulsatile manner.\nInvestigations include a carotid angiogram and MRI scan. This tumour should not be biopsied due to the risk of haemorrhage.\nCarotid body tumours rarely (3%) metastasize, and their overall rate of growth is slow. The need for surgical removal must be considered carefully, as complications of surgery are potentially serious. Treatment is surgical."

            "explanation": "1. A A short course of steroids\nStertor is the sound made by upper airway obstruction at a level above the larynx. The Epstein-Barr virus can cause tonsillitis, often presenting with a grey or white film over the tonsils. The tonsils can be enlarged sufficiently to threaten the airway. If they fail to respond to antibiotics, a short course of steroids should be given.\n2. G Per-oral incision and drainage\nThis patient has a peritonsillar abscess, which can be treated with incision and drainage through the mouth. The mucosa is prepared with a local anaesthetic spray, and a scalpel blade is used to incise the abscess wall. These patients will also be managed with antibiotics, fluids and analgesia until their oral intake is sufficient. An alternative option is aspiration with a 10-mL syringe and wide-bore needle.\n3. I Transfer to theatre with experienced anaesthetist and surgeon\nThis child should be considered to have epiglottitis. These patients should be managed in a calm environment, with nothing done to upset them, particularly no attempts to examine the throat, which can precipitate respiratory arrest. The patient should be transferred to theatre and examined under anaesthetic with an experienced anaesthetist and a surgeon capable of performing paediatric tracheostomy if required. If the diagnosis is confirmed the team can move straight to intubation, take culture samples and institute antimicrobial therapy. In advanced cases where intubation is impossible, tracheostomy will be life saving, but most cases can be managed medically.\n4. C Early tracheostomy\nBlunt laryngeal trauma can result in loss of the airway, and prompt intervention might be required. Endotracheal intubation should be avoided as the foreign-body reaction to the tube can result in permanent laryngeal damage. An early tracheostomy is appropriate, with inspection of the larynx and repair of mucosal and cartilage injuries in an attempt to minimise long-term loss of function.\n5. D Endoscopic debridement of lesions\nRecurrent respiratory papillomatosis is a condition that HPV 6 and 11 cause. Following a biopsy for histological confirmation, the lesions should be excised endoscopically using a microdebrider, cold steel, or laser. This condition is characterised by recurrent growth of papillomas and multiple procedures. The underlying tissues must not be damaged as this condition often improves after puberty and the aim is to maintain the normal function of the larynx as far as possible."
