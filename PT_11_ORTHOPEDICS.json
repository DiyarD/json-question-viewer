            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Most meniscal tears are produced by flexion and rapid rotation.\n- A classic example (\"football knee\") involves a player who is hit while running, with the knee slightly flexed and the foot anchored to the ground by cleats.\n- Impact from an opposing player usually causes rotation almost entirely restricted to the knee.\n- The injury involves rapid rotation of the flexed femoral condyles about the tibial plateau, which most frequently tears the medial meniscus (less frequently, the lateral meniscus).\n- A tear in the inner free border of the cartilage is also common whenever excessive rotation without flexion or extension occurs.\n- Early surgical removal of the displaced menisci is usually recommended to prevent further damage to the cartilage or ligaments."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- The glenohumeral joint is bounded posteriorly by the teres minor and infraspinatus muscles and partially by the long head of the triceps.\n- It is bounded laterally by the powerful deltoid muscle; superiorly, the acromion process precludes upward dislocation.\n- However, anteriorly and inferiorly the pectoralis major and the long head of the biceps do not completely stabilize the glenohumeral joint.\n- In this region, the articular ligaments and joint capsule provide the major structural support.\n- Thus, the joint is not strongly supported in its anteroinferior aspect, and consequently anterior (or anteroinferior) dislocations are the most common glenohumeral dislocations.\n- The humeral head is driven anteriorly, which tears the shoulder capsule, detaches the labrum from the glenoid, and produces a compression fracture of the humeral head.\n- Most glenohumeral dislocations result from a posteriorly directed force on an arm that is partially abducted.\n- Posterior dislocation is much rarer and should raise the possibility of a seizure as the precipitating cause."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- Longitudinal growth of bone follows ossification of cartilage that forms at the epiphyseal plate.\n- Fractures that involve separation of the growth plate (type I, almost always on the diaphyseal side) may be realigned; normal growth usually follows epiphyseal separation because the proliferative cells are still attached to their blood supply in the bone epiphysis.\n- Fractures that extend perpendicular to and through the epiphysis (types II, III, IV) may result in the formation of bony bridges across the epiphysis that can disrupt later growth.\n- Though all the fractures listed in the question place the epiphyseal growth plate in some jeopardy, crushing injuries to the epiphysis (type V) have the worst prognosis.\n- Numerous bony bridges may form and prevent longitudinal growth."

            "explanation": "- Postmenopausal osteoporosis is responsible for a large number of fractures in elderly women, characterized by decreased total bone mass and trabecular volume despite normal mineralization.\n- Common fracture sites are the vertebrae, distal radius, and hip.\n- Vertebral compression fractures are often sustained by elderly men and women even without trauma.\n- A minor fall on the outstretched hand can lead to a Colles' fracture when the distal radius is weakened by osteoporosis.\n- Similarly, either a femoral neck fracture or an intertrochanteric fracture can follow a fall on the hip.\n- Clavicular fractures are less likely to result from osteoporosis.\n- While these fractures occur in both children and adults, they are common in healthy children and young adults after violent falls onto an outstretched hand."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Compartment syndromes result from increasing pressures in the fascial compartments of the arm or leg.\n- When the pressure in the muscles is greater than that of the capillaries, ischemia and necrosis of the muscles occur even though the arterial pressure is still high enough to produce pulses; pulselessness is an unreliable sign.\n- Extreme pain (out of proportion to the injury), pain on passive extension of the fingers or toes, pallor of the extremity, motor paralysis, and paresthesias are all components of the syndrome.\n- The patient will usually hold the injured part in a position of flexion to maximally relax the fascia and reduce the pain; passive extension will usually produce severe pain.\n- The diagnosis can be confirmed by measuring intracompartmental pressures, but whenever physical findings or symptoms are suspicious, immediate surgical decompression by fasciectomy is indicated since delay is likely to lead to irreversible damage."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Open reduction of a fracture involves the restoration of normal bone alignment under direct observation at surgery.\n- In effect, open reduction converts a simple fracture into a compound (or open) fracture and thereby increases the risk of infection.\n- Operative manipulation also increases trauma at the fracture site and may consequently add to the probability of infection.\n- Hematomas at the site of fracture may be important for early healing; open reduction, which usually involves removing the clots in the field, could contribute to a delay in bone healing and to nonunion.\n- The major advantage of open reduction is the shorter period of immobilization it allows, an advantage that often outweighs all the disadvantages previously mentioned, as in the open reduction of femoral neck fractures in the elderly.\n- This allows these patients to get out of bed much sooner than if they were treated with several weeks of traction."
