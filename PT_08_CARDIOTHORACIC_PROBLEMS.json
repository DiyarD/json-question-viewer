            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- With the exception of coarctation, the anomalies listed cause a shunting of blood between the systemic and lower-pressure pulmonary circulation.\n- Transposition of the great vessels is a right-to-left shunt that leads to cyanosis.\n- Patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defects cause a shunting of oxygenated blood back into the pulmonary artery and right atrium, typically causing \"recirculation\" of oxygenated blood within the cardiopulmonary circuit but not cyanosis, unless there is persistent congenital pulmonary hypertension.\n- When a ventricular septal defect is combined with pulmonary artery atresia (tetralogy of Fallot), the resulting undercirculation in the pulmonary system joins transposition as a cause of cyanosis.\n- Other less common congenital lesions with relatively decreased pulmonary arterial blood flow include tricuspid atresia, Ebstein's anomaly, and hypoplastic right ventricle."

            "explanation": "- Superior vena cava obstruction is almost always due to malignancy.\n- In three out of four cases, it results from invasion of the vena cava by bronchogenic carcinoma.\n- Lymphomas account for most of the remaining cases of the superior vena cava syndrome.\n- Fibrosing mediastinitis (as a complication of histoplasmosis or methysergide ingestion) may occur but is rare.\n- Rarely, a substernal thyroid or thoracic aortic aneurysm may be responsible for the obstruction.\n- Although constrictive pericarditis may decrease venous return to the heart, it does not produce obstruction of the superior vena cava.\n- The resultant increased venous pressure produces edema of the upper body, cyanosis, dilated subcutaneous collateral vessels in the chest, and headache.\n- Cervical lymphadenopathy may also be present.\n- When carcinoma is the cause, treatment is usually palliative and consists of diuretics and radiation."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Perforation of the esophagus in the chest is a surgical catastrophe requiring aggressive intervention in virtually all circumstances.\n- While intervention can usually consist of efforts to patch the perforation and drain the mediastinum, concomitant obstructive esophageal disease (inflammatory stenosis or cancer) mandates removal or bypass of the obstruction to control the leak and consequent mediastinal and pleural contamination.\n- For distal esophageal cancers, many thoracic surgeons use the classic Ivor-Lewis operation, involving mobilizing the stomach in the abdomen and then performing a right thoracotomy with mediastinal cleanout, esophagectomy, and esophagogastrostomy.\n- A left thoracotomy approach might be used in some circumstances.\n- The transhiatal approach would probably be avoided in this situation where an unknown amount of mediastinal contamination has taken place."

            "explanation": "- Corrosive injuries of the esophagus most frequently occur in young children due to accidental ingestion of strong alkaline cleaning agents.\n- Significant esophageal injury occurs in 15% of patients with no oropharyngeal injury, while 70% of patients with oropharyngeal injury have no esophageal damage.\n- Signs of airway injury or imminent obstruction warrant close observation and possibly tracheostomy.\n- The risk of adding injury, particularly in a child, makes esophagoscopy contraindicated by most surgeons.\n- Administration of oral “antidotes” is ineffective unless given within moments of ingestion; even then, additional damage from chemical reactions of neutralization often makes their use unwise.\n- A barium esophagogram is usually done within 24 hours unless evidence of perforation is present.\n- In most reports, steroids in conjunction with antibiotics reduce the incidence of stricture formation from about 70% to about 15%.\n- Vomiting should be avoided, if possible, to prevent further corrosive injury and possible aspiration.\n- It is probably wise to avoid all oral intake until the full extent of injury is ascertained."
