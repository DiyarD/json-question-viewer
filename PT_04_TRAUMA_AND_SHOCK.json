            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "*   The finding of an air-fluid level in the left lower chest with a nasogastric tube entering it after blunt trauma to the abdomen is diagnostic of diaphragmatic rupture with gastric herniation into the chest.\n*   This lesion needs to be fixed immediately.\n*   Continuing negative pressure in the chest sucks more abdominal contents into the chest and increases the likelihood of vascular compromise of the herniated viscera.\n*   While the diaphragm is easily fixed from the left chest, this injury should be approached from the abdomen.\n*   The possibility of injury below the diaphragm after sufficient blunt injury to rupture the diaphragm mandates examination of the intraabdominal solid and hollow viscera.\n*   Adequate exposure of the diaphragm to allow secure repair is possible from this approach."

            "explanation": "*   In rapid-deceleration injuries associated with automobile crashes, abdominal viscera tend to continue moving anteriorly after the body wall has been stopped.\n*   These organs exert great stress upon the structures anchoring them to the retroperitoneum.\n*   Intestinal loops stretch and may tear their mesenteric attachments, injuring and thrombosing the superior mesenteric artery; kidneys and spleen may similarly shear their vascular pedicles.\n*   In these injuries, however, ordinarily the intraabdominal pressure does not rise excessively and diaphragmatic hernia is not likely.\n*   Diaphragmatic hernia is primarily associated with compression-type abdominal or thoracic injuries that increase intraabdominal or intrathoracic pressure sufficiently to tear the central portion of the diaphragm."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "*   In the past, ligation rather than repair of large veins in the extremities has been advocated in patients with multiple injuries or severe trauma.\n*   Venous repair adds to the operative time, often results in thrombosis and occlusion, and was thought to lead to an increased incidence of pulmonary embolization.\n*   Recent studies, including reviews of the Viet Nam Vascular Registry, indicate that the risk of pulmonary embolization is not increased with repair and that vein repair, in conjunction with arterial repair, increases limb salvage, particularly in popliteal injuries.\n*   Venous repair may also be necessary in the presence of extensive soft tissue trauma and an already severely compromised venous return.\n*   Long-term follow-up reveals that the sequelae of chronic venous insufficiency develop with increasing frequency in those patients who have had ligations of lower-extremity veins.\n*   Morbidity from chronic deep venous occlusion may be diminished even in those patients who develop thrombosis following repair, because recanalization often occurs.\n*   Ligated veins do not recanalize.\n*   For these reasons, it is currently recommended that large veins be repaired whenever clinically feasible."

This is not the case, however, and increased levels of the thyroid hormones are not seen.\n*   Vasopressin (ADH) is regulated by the serum osmolality. In the postinjury period many factors are at play that provoke the excretion of vasopressin.\n*   Glucagon secretion is normal or increased after injury; not only are aldosterone levels elevated, but the diurnal fluctuations ordinarily seen are lost."
