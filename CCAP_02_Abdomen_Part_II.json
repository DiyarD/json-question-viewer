            "explanation": "- Rectus sheath hematoma arises from bleeding into the rectus muscle sheath, often due to trauma to epigastric vessels or the rectus muscle itself.\n- Spontaneous rectus sheath bleeding has increased due to greater use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications.\n- Most hematomas are self-limited and can be managed with observation.\n- In cases of ongoing bleeding and shock, angioembolization is the best treatment option, as it identifies the bleeding vessel that may be difficult to see directly.\n- Open operative approach or percutaneous drainage may release tamponade effect, increasing bleeding.\n- Direct pressure is not feasible due to location.\n- Exploratory laparotomy is not necessary."

            "explanation": "- Spontaneous atraumatic splenic rupture is infrequent but potentially life-threatening, mainly occurring in histologically abnormal spleens.\n- A systematic review identified 6 major etiologic groups: neoplastic (30.3%), infectious (27.3%), inflammatory/noninfectious (20%), drug/treatment-related (9.2%), mechanical disorders (6.8%), and normal spleen (6.4%).\n- Malignant hematologic disorders, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia, are the most common cause of atraumatic splenic rupture.\n- Splenic involvement in hydatid disease is uncommon (0.9-8%), and cyst rupture is a primary infection route.\n- Mononucleosis is the most common infectious cause.\n- Splenic artery aneurysms are third most common intra-abdominal aneurysms, with a 2-3% rupture risk, increased in portal hypertension, post-liver transplant, or pregnancy.\n- Splenic infarcts are often asymptomatic; complications include febrile illness, abscess, pseudocyst, rupture, and hemorrhage.\n- Impending splenic rupture is considered with progressive liquefaction or expansion of infarcted tissue."
