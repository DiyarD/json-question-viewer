            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy revolutionized general surgery, but its adoption was associated with an increase in common bile duct injuries compared with open cholecystectomy, due to lack of depth perception and decreased tactile feedback.\n- To address this, Steven Strasberg and Nathaniel Soper proposed the Critical View of Safety technique, which has 3 key components:\n    - Complete clearing of the hepatocystic triangle of all fat and fibrous material.\n    - Separation of the lower part of the gallbladder from the cystic plate.\n    - Identification of 2 and only 2 structures (cystic duct and cystic artery) remaining attached to the gallbladder.\n- The Critical View of Safety should be confirmed intraoperatively by demonstrating these 3 elements before clipping and dividing the cystic artery and duct.\n- If the Critical View of Safety cannot be attained during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the surgeon should proceed with other \"bail out\" options, such as open conversion or subtotal fenestrating cholecystectomy.\n- In the image that shows the correct answer (Figure 6.5), all 3 elements of the critical view of safety are present.\n- In the remaining images, dissection is incomplete, and the images do not demonstrate all 3 elements of the critical view of safety."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- This patient has a biliary cystadenoma.\n- Biliary cystadenomas constitute up to 5% of all hepatic cysts and 10% of cysts larger than 4 cm.\n- Symptoms are typically related to size and include anorexia, early satiety, and abdominal discomfort.\n- Imaging demonstrates heterogeneous septations within the cyst, irregular papillary growths, and thickened cyst walls.\n- The cysts typically show hyperintensity on MRI T2 weighting.\n- Biliary cystadenomas are premalignant lesions that can progress to biliary cystadenocarcinoma.\n- As such, they require surgical removal, either via resection with clear margins or enucleation at the level of the pseudocapsule. Anatomic resection is not required.\n- Hepatic cystic disease is present in up to 5% of the population and includes congenital (simple liver cysts, polycystic liver disease - PCLD) and acquired pathologies (infectious, neoplastic).\n- Simple cysts appear thin walled without internal septations; treatment is via aspiration/sclerosis or surgical unroofing for symptomatic cysts.\n- PCLD has 3 variants; treatment varies by type (aspiration/sclerosis, unroofing, resection, or transplantation).\n- Hydatid cysts arise from parasitic infection (Echinococcus granulosis); symptoms include fever, malaise, right upper quadrant pain; CT/MRI reveal thick-walled, calcified cysts with daughter cells; diagnosis by serologic testing; treatment includes open surgical pericystectomy or PAIR technique with antihelminthic drugs. Imaging findings in case are not consistent with echinococcal disease.\n- Pyogenic liver and amebic abscesses are other infectious etiologies. Pyogenic abscesses are bacterial, may have air-fluid levels, treated with antibiotics and aspiration. Amebic abscesses (Entamoeba histolytica) are treated with metronidazole, identified by serologic testing."

            "explanation": "- Obstruction of the upper gastrointestinal tract can result from congenital anomalies or acquired conditions.\n- Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is an acquired condition typically seen after significant rapid weight loss or surgery (e.g., scoliosis).\n- The main anatomic feature is the narrowing of the angle between the aorta and the SMA from its normal 38-65° to less than 25°.\n- This narrowing results in compression of the third part of the duodenum as it crosses between the aorta and the SMA.\n- Affected patients typically present with nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and epigastric pain.\n- Diagnosis can be made with fine slice CT imaging of the abdominal aorta and its branches, demonstrating an aorto-superior mesenteric artery angle of less than 25°.\n- Initial treatment focuses on correction of electrolyte abnormalities and careful refeeding.\n- Once the patient's nutritional status is restored, performance of a duodenojejunostomy can provide significant symptomatic relief and help restore a durable nutritional state."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- A duodenal web occurs as a result of the incomplete recanalization of the duodenum during the eighth through tenth weeks of gestation.\n- This results in the presence of a persistent membranous structure within the lumen of the duodenum that has the appearance of a windsock (opening 3 to 5 mm in diameter).\n- Affected patients may present in childhood with abdominal distention and vomiting, or remain asymptomatic until adulthood with epigastric pain exacerbated by eating and relieved by vomiting.\n- Diagnosis: upper gastrointestinal barium examination demonstrating barium retention at the web site and mimicking a duodenal diverticulum.\n- The preferred surgical option for the treatment of a duodenal web is duodenotomy with excision of the web.\n- Complete failure of recanalization of the duodenum after the seventh week of gestation, either as a result of an ischemic insult or genetic factors, results in duodenal atresia.\n- Diagnosis of duodenal atresia is often made on prenatal ultrasound demonstrating polyhydramnios.\n- Postnatal presentation is characterized by persistent bilious emesis, gastric distension, and poor feeding.\n- The classic finding on a plain radiograph of the abdomen is a \"double bubble\" sign due to distension of the smaller proximal duodenum and larger stomach and the absence of gas in the bowel distal to the duodenum.\n- Due to the high potential for aspiration, contrast studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract should not be performed.\n- A nasogastric or orogastric tube should be placed to decompress the stomach and proximal duodenum.\n- Once the infant is clinically stabilized, a duodenoduodenostomy or duodenojejunostomy should be performed.\n- With proper surgical correction, the long-term prognosis for duodenal atresia is quite good, provided that no other significant congenital anomalies are present.\n- Annular pancreas is a congenital condition resulting from the tethering of the ventral pancreatic bud to the duodenum, leading to a ring of pancreatic tissue encircling the duodenum.\n- Annular pancreas is diagnosed with nearly equal frequency in children and adults; children typically present within the first 2 days of life with duodenal or gastric outlet obstruction.\n- Symptoms in affected children include vomiting, bloating, and food intolerance. Duodenal bypass is very effective at relieving the duodenal obstruction related to annular pancreas in children.\n- Initial presentation of annular pancreas in adults is symptomatic upper abdominal pain; adults have a lower incidence of duodenal obstruction and a much higher incidence of complex pancreaticobiliary pathology.\n- Diagnosis in adults is most commonly made by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and CT scan of the abdomen.\n- Surgical treatment of annular pancreas in adults requires a broader array of potential options, including cholecystectomy, duodenal bypass, or pancreatic procedures."

The Fukuoka guidelines add jaundice to these \"high-risk\" criteria.\n- The patient presented has none of these features, and therefore neither of the operations listed is indicated.\n- Both sets of guidelines list \"worrisome\" features for which further workup is indicated: dilated pancreatic duct without solid cyst component, solid cyst component without duct dilation, and a cyst larger than 3 cm.\n- The Fukuoka guidelines add a history of pancreatitis and a thickened enhancing cyst wall.\n- Per the AGA recommendations, patients having 2 worrisome features (as presented: cyst >3cm and solid component with thickened wall) should have further workup with endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration for cyst cytology.\n- Core needle biopsy of the cyst wall is not necessary because the diagnostic goal is to sample the cyst contents.\n- Per AGA guidelines, patients without worrisome features should undergo repeat imaging in 1 year, with MRI preferred over CT scan.\n- Without a diagnosis, cyst enucleation or pancreaticoduodenectomy is not appropriate."

            "explanation": "- Cysts of the biliary tree, called choledochal cysts, are rare, occurring more commonly in people of Asian descent and 3 to 8 times more common in women than in men.\n- The Todani classification system is based on cyst location and includes 5 types.\n- Challenges to the Todani classification system include that gallbladder diverticulum, choledochoceles, and Caroli disease are not related to other forms of choledochal cysts.\n- Malignancy is most commonly associated with type I and IV cysts, whereas type II, III, and V choledochal cysts have minimal neoplastic risk.\n- Choledochal cysts present differently in adults and children: children present with an abdominal mass and jaundice; adults present with biliary or pancreatic symptoms and symptomatic cholelithiasis (40-70%).\n- Malignancy occurs in 10-30% of adults with a choledochal cyst. Early surgical correction is recommended given the risk of malignancy.\n- Most choledochal cysts are diagnosed by imaging because presenting symptoms are often nonspecific.\n- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is often not useful in diagnosing a suspected choledochal cyst (difficult to fill dilated biliary tree) and is more invasive than magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP).\n- MRCP helps create a complete cholangiogram and has become the noninvasive procedure of choice for the diagnosis of choledochal cysts.\n- Many surgeons now consider MRCP the only imaging technique needed for diagnosis and operative planning.\n- Routine liver scans are not useful when trying to image the biliary tree.\n- Duodenal aspirates are used to diagnose cholelithiasis when other diagnostic evaluations fail to identify a reason for continued abdominal pain."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- The definition of a complex abdominal wall hernia is varied but depends on both hernia factors and patient factors (Figure 14.1 lists factors such as BMI > 35, smoking, diabetes mellitus, steroid use, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, intraoperative enterotomy or bowel resection, urgent procedure for incarceration or obstruction, hernias from damage control laparotomies with sequential closing, hernias with contaminated wounds from ostomies, fistulas, or prior surgical site infections, recurrent hernias, and prolonged operative time).\n- Complex hernias deserve mesh placement to help prevent recurrence.\n- This patient has a complex hernia because of the previous wound infection, which increases the rate of primary hernia occurrence and recurrence after repair.\n- History of infection does not preclude the use of mesh in this operation.\n- This patient has several other risk factors for hernia repair failure, including a BMI greater than 35 and hypertension.\n- Use of mesh as a bridge between fascial edges should be avoided due to its high recurrence rate.\n- A retrorectus placement of mesh is favored, but onlay and underlay mesh placement can also be used.\n- For larger hernias, retrorectus placement will require a fascial release such as a transverse abdominis rectus fascia or a component separation.\n- The use of biologic or permanent mesh depends on the contamination of the field.\n- It is believed, but not proven, that a biologic mesh has risk of infection but a higher risk of recurrence. Permanent meshes have opposite concerns; neither is ideal.\n- The Ventral Hernia Working Group grade helps determine the risk of infection and recurrence for hernia repairs.\n- In general, surgeons place biologic mesh in fields where there is a high risk of contamination and place permanent mesh in low- to moderate-risk situations.\n- In patients with a high risk due to patient factors (tobacco, obesity, type 2 diabetes), biologic mesh is often used.\n- Cross-linking is an attribute used to describe biologic meshes; it appears to increase durability, tensile strength, and resistance to bacterial contamination. There is no evidence, though, that cross-linking or non-cross-linking is superior to the other.\n- Ultimately, patient factors and hernia factors determine the likelihood of recurrence or complication.\n- The risk of infection (from the hernia or the patient) will determine if biologic or permanent mesh is to be used. Balancing the risk of infection versus recurrence will guide the surgeon toward permanent versus biologic mesh in this case."

Controversy continues regarding the management when surgery is indicated.\n- When comparing the laparoscopic approach to thoracic approach, the thoracic approach has an increased length of stay, higher risk of pulmonary embolism, and greater need for mechanical ventilation.\n- Complete excision of the mediastinal hernia sac and fundoplication are associated with a lower risk of recurrence.\n- Mesh repair is associated with a lower risk of recurrence but is also associated with long-term complications, including esophageal stenosis, mesh erosion, and infection.\n- Therefore, current strategies include watchful waiting and surgery when symptoms dictate the need.\n- Surgical strategy includes excision of the sac, primary closure of the crural defect, and fundoplication without routine use of mesh."
