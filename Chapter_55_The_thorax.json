            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "The left lung is divided into an upper lobe and lower lobe by the oblique fissure. There are five segments in the upper lobe and four in the lower lobe. Each segment is an anatomically defined unit with named bronchi, pulmonary artery branch and pulmonary vein tributary.\nThe right lung, on the other hand, has three lobes. An oblique fissure separates the upper and lower lobes. The upper lobe is further separated from a middle lobe by a horizontal fissure. The right lung also has the same number of segmental divisions distributed as follows: three in the upper, two in the middle and four in the lower lobe."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The gas transfer factor, also called ‘diffusion capacity' (DLCO) is a measure of the overall ability of the lungs to transfer gases from the alveoli to blood. It is a test of the integrity of the alveolar-capillary surface area of the lungs for gas exchange and is affected by the patient's haemoglobin level. The test involves the inhalation of a test gas that contains a small amount of carbon monoxide. The uptake of carbon monoxide into blood is affected by the haemoglobin concentration. Low haemoglobin concentration as is seen in anaemia will reduce the uptake (transfer) of carbon monoxide, while high haemoglobin levels as occur in polycythaemia vera will increase the transfer factor."

            ],
            "explanation": "In tension pneumothorax, positive pressure builds up in the hemithorax as air accumulates through a breach in the visceral pleura, which acts like a valve allowing a unidirectional flow of air out of the lung. The high intrapleural pressure results in compression of the ipsilateral lung, flattening of the hemidiaphragm, mediastinal distortion and shift and impairment of venous return to the heart and hence a reduction of cardiac output.\nPleural effusion results from interference with either the mechanisms of pleural fluid production by capillaries of parietal pleura or absorption by the capillaries of the visceral pleura. Depending on the protein concentration, pleural effusions are classified as transudates (less than 30 g/L) or exudates (30 g/L or more).\nIn cardiac failure, the pulmonary capillary pressure is elevated, leading to increased production of pleural effusion with low protein content.\nRenal and hepatic failures are associated with low plasma protein and intravascular oncotic pressure. The pleural effusion that results from reduced pleural fluid absorption is low in protein content. Inflammatory diseases increase pleural capillary permeability to cause the accumulation of fluid and protein. Malignancy obstructs the lymphatic system and causes a protein-rich pleural effusion.\nThe pleural cavity is sterile but the bronchial tree is not. A breech of the sterile barrier between the pleura and bronchial system on one hand (endogenous), and between the pleura and external environment (exogenous) on the other, increases the risk of empyema (infection within the pleural space). Iatrogenic introduction of bacteria into the pleural space can occur during aspiration of effusions, insertion of chest drains, thoracoscopy and thoracotomy. Traumatic haemothorax provides a favourable culture medium for infection. Endogenous spread can occur from pneumonia, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, fungal infections and lung abscess.\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is a less invasive method for investigating and treating thoracic pathologies, including pleural diseases such as pneumothorax, pleural effusion and empyema. VAT plays a major role in the management of thoracic diseases.\nIntercostal chest drains are fundamental to the management of chest disease. The insertion of chest drains can be lifesaving, and they are used as sole therapeutic interventions or adjunctive to other thoracic procedures."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Most lung cancer lesions or their secondary effects are detected on chest radiograph. Pleural effusion, distal lung collapse or consolidation due to bronchial obstruction and raised hemidiaphragm due to invasion of phrenic nerve are some secondary effects of lung cancer seen on chest radiograph.\nCT is central to further characterisation of primary lung cancer with regard to site, tumour size (T stage), proximity to chest wall and mediastinal structures and mediastinal lymph node status (N stage). It also facilitates percutaneous biopsy for peripheral lesions.\nPositron emission tomography shows high uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) by lesions with high metabolism, so in addition to cancer, infections and other inflammatory lesions show avid uptake of FDG. Therefore, it does not have a high specificity for lung cancer.\nSputum cytology has a high false-negative rate because it relies on the probability of obtaining a sample with exfoliated tumour cells, which can be low for peripheral lung cancers.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) mediastinoscopy, mediastinotomy and thoracoscopy are techniques for obtaining mediastinal lymph node biopsies, and are useful in assessing the extent of tumour spread (staging) and sometimes for establishing histological diagnosis."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The principle of surgery with curative intent for lung cancer is to excise all the cancer tissue in the lung and the lymph nodes, while conserving as much unaffected lung tissue as possible. Surgical excision of lung cancer can be achieved by anatomical resections such as segmentectomy, lobectomy, bilobectomy and pneumonectomy, and nonanatomical resection such as wedge resection. This should be combined with removal of mediastinal lymph nodes that are involved. This is accomplished by either excision of enlarged lymph nodes (sampling) or en bloc dissection of the mediastinal lymph nodes (systematic dissection)."

            "explanation": "1. A Bronchoscopy\nHaemoptysis is commonly caused by bronchopulmonary trauma, infection, or neoplastic (benign and malignant) lesions of pulmonary system. The underlying pathologies are usually in direct or indirect communication with the bronchial tree. Bronchoscopy affords the ability to visualise the lesion, the potential to obtain biopsies or treat, or the insight to plan further treatment. The flexible bronchoscope can be advanced into segmental bronchi and is useful for obtaining sputum and tissue biopsies. As the calibre is small and suction limited, flexible bronchoscopes might not have optimal diagnostic and therapeutic yield soon after an episode of haemoptysis because blood clots obscure visualisation. Rigid bronchoscopy overcomes these setbacks but requires general anaesthesia.\n\n2. C Chest drain insertion\nMorphological changes such as mediastinal shift, elevation of the hemidiaphragm and crowding of the ribs occur after pneumonectomy to contract the pneumonectomy space, which fills with tissue fluid. Dehiscence of the bronchial stump occurs in bronchopleural fistula to establish communication between colonised bronchial tree and sterile pneumonectomy space. Invariably, the pneumonectomy space and contained fluid get infected due to the bronchopleural fistula. Signs of systemic infection (pyrexia) with clinical (expectorating purulent sputum) and radiological (high fluid level) evidences of infected collection in the chest warrant immediate chest drain insertion, to control the source of sepsis. Further management of bronchopleural fistula is undertaken in specialised centres.\n\n3. D Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the chest\nA mediastinal mass on chest radiograph deserves further investigation with CT scan of the chest to define the site, size, nature and attachments of the mass and surrounding structures, and, where possible, to obtain a guided percutaneous biopsy for histological diagnosis. On the basis of the location in the mediastinum, the possible cause of the mass can be suspected. Common mediastinal masses in different parts of the mediastinum are the following:\n• Superior mediastinum – lymphoma, thyroid and parathyroid\n• Anterior mediastinum – thymoma, lymphoma and germ cell tumour\n• Middle mediastinum – cystic lesions, lymphoma and mesenchymal tumours\n• Posterior mediastinum – neurogenic tumours, cystic lesions and mesenchymal tumours.\n\n4. E Pulmonary function tests\nTo determine the fitness of patients for lung resection, and the extent of resection they can tolerate, pulmonary function tests are necessary. Peak expiratory flow rate, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁), forced vital capacity (FVC), diffusion capacity (DLCO) and arterial blood gases provide useful information. Patients with borderline fitness based on pulmonary function test can be subjected to cardiopulmonary exercise testing or shuttle walk testing.\n\n5. B Thoracotomy\nThoracotomy involves muscle cutting, rib-spreading and parietal pleura breeching. Sometimes rib fractures occur, and the intercostal nerves are bruised during rib-spreading. In the early postoperative period, therefore, thoracotomy pain can be severe and difficult to control. The functional consequence of post-thoracotomy pain leads to other complications such as impairment of mobilisation and normal breathing and gas exchange. The strategies commonly used to manage early post-thoracotomy pain include oral analgesia with paracetamol, and intravenous opiates used as patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or local anaesthesia delivered via catheters into the paravertebral or extrapleural space.\n\n6. F Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)\nVATS enables complete drainage of the pleural effusion and sampling the effusion for cytological assessment, direct visualisation of the pleural cavity and making a clinical judgement, guided multiple pleural biopsies for histological analyses and talc pleurodesis. The role of VATS in managing pleural disease is well established and clearly of advantage because of its less-invasive nature and faster postoperative recovery compared to thoracotomy."
