            "explanation": "- Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a peptide hormone produced by endotoxin-activated monocytes/macrophages.\nt is postulated to be the principal cytokine mediator in gram-negative shock and sepsis-related organ damage.\n- Biologic actions of TNF include polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) activation and degranulation, increased nonspecific host resistance, increased vascular permeability, lymphopenia, promotion of interleukins 1, 2, and 6, capillary leak syndrome, microvascular thrombosis, anorexia and cachexia, and numerous other protective and adverse effects in sepsis.\n- Its role in sepsis is a fertile field for research in critical care."

            "explanation": "- The purpose of a cross-match is to determine whether the recipient has circulating antibodies against donor HLA antigens.\n- Such antibodies do not occur naturally but are the result of prior sensitization during pregnancy, blood transfusions, or previous transplantation.\n- A complement-dependent lymphocytotoxicity cross-match is performed by adding recipient serum and complement to donor cells (T cells, B cells, or monocytes).\n- If specific anti-donor antibodies are present, antibody binding results in complement fixation and cell lysis, which is detected by the addition of a vital dye taken up by the damaged cell membrane, resulting in a positive cross-match.\n- If a positive cross-match is detected to donor T cells (HLA class I), transplantation will result in hyperacute rejection."

            "explanation": "- Patients who are acceptable candidates for kidney transplantation should usually undergo this form of treatment after stabilization, as mortality for chronic hemodialysis is now higher than for transplantation.\n- Transplantation restores more patients to happier and more productive lives compared with chronic dialysis.\n- The best graft survival rates for living related transplants (over 90% at 5 years) are obtained when all six histocompatibility loci are identical.\n- All family members of potential transplant recipients should be tissue typed, and the donor should be selected based on the closest match, if feasible.\n- With cyclosporine-based immunosuppression, cadaveric kidney graft survival has approached that of living-related transplantation.\n- Some transplanters believe that the slight improvement with living-related kidneys does not justify the risk to the donor, suggesting these transplantations should no longer be performed."

            "explanation": "- A positive cross-match means the recipient has circulating antibodies cytotoxic to donor-strain lymphocytes.\n- This incompatibility almost always leads to acute humoral rejection of the graft and precludes transplantation.\n- Blood type matching prior to organ allograft is similar to cross-matching prior to transfusion; O is the universal donor, and AB is the universal recipient.\n- Minor blood group factors do not appear to act as histocompatibility antigens.\n- Matching of HLA antigens in cadaveric renal transplants may improve graft survival, but the impact is relatively minor.\n- A two-antigen match is perfectly acceptable, and even zero-antigen matches can be transplanted with good results.\n- Neither hypertension nor anemia is a contraindication to transplantation; hypertension may be cured or ameliorated, and anemia generally improves following successful transplantation due to increased erythropoietin production by the graft."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Hyperacute rejection is mediated by cytotoxic antibodies, triggering the complement, coagulation, and kinin systems.\n- It can occur during surgery after vascular anastomosis clamps are released, exposing recipient antibodies to donor passenger lymphocytes and kidney tissue.\n- The kidney typically becomes swollen and pale.\n- Hyperacute rejection causes immediate and early oliguria; biopsies should be performed intraoperatively or early postoperatively.\n- Pathologically, it is characterized by fibrin and platelet thrombosis and necrosis of glomerular tufts, renal arterioles, and small arteries.\n- Massive polymorphonuclear infiltrate with tubular necrosis occurs 24–36 hours post-transplantation.\n- Intravascular coagulation rarely results in systemic coagulopathy.\n- Careful cross-matching can test for cytotoxic antibodies.\n- To date, there is no adequate prevention or treatment for hyperacute rejection, although plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide can transiently decrease the preformed antibody load."

            "explanation": "- Chemotherapy is generally most effective at killing rapidly dividing cells, placing fresh surgical wounds at risk in the early postoperative period.\n- All phases of normal wound healing are theoretically at risk from various chemotherapeutic agents.\n- Immediately after wounding, inflammation and vascular permeability lead to fibrin deposition and polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN), monocyte, and platelet influx.\n- Macrophages are attracted by the activated complement system.\n- The proliferative phase begins by the fourth day, with fibroblasts producing mucopolysaccharides and collagen for the next 20 days.\n- Collagen fiber cross-linking continues for several months in the maturation phase.\n- It is logical to delay antineoplastic agents for 10–14 days unless compelling clinical indications (e.g., superior vena cava syndrome) necessitate more urgent treatment.\n- Administration of folinic acid simultaneously with methotrexate normalizes wound healing.\n- Extravasation of chemotherapeutic agents during intravenous administration can cause severe ulceration and sloughing, largely related to the agent's nucleic-acid-binding characteristics.\n- Agents that do not bind to tissue nucleic acid (vincristine, vinblastine, nitrogen mustard, BCNU, 5-FU) generally cause only local damage from immediate injury, are quickly metabolized or inactivated, and allow for usual wound healing patterns.\n- Agents that bind nucleic acid (doxorubicin, dactinomycin, mitomycin C, mithramycin, and daunorubicin) cause immediate toxic reaction and, unless excised, continuing and progressive tissue damage.\n- While some report success with elevation and ice packs, most recommend surgical excision for severe pain, early necrosis, or significant blistering."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Only about 30% of the biologic damage from x-rays is due to direct effects on the target molecule; the rest is from indirect action mediated by free radicals, modifiable by scavengers like sulfhydryl.\n- The percentage of cells killed by a given dose of x-rays or gamma rays significantly increases with molecular oxygen; oxygen-deficient cells are radiation-resistant.\n- A basic principle of radiation biology is that mammalian cell sensitivity to radiation varies with their position in the cell division cycle; M phase (mitotic phase) cells are the most radiosensitive.\n- Radiation is frequently used for local disease control.\n- Survival rates for breast lumpectomy and radiation are equal to those of mastectomy, but local control rates (10–15% recurrence at 10 years for stage I and II cancers treated with lumpectomy and radiation versus approximately 5% treated with mastectomy) are inferior.\n- Rapidly dividing cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa and bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation effects."
