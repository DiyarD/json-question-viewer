                "A The hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint.",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The blood supply to the femoral head is from the retinacular branches of the medial circumflex femoral artery, with minimal contribution from the ligamentum teres. This is an important point when considering femoral neck fracture, as these arteries are intimately related to the periosteum within the joint capsule and so are disrupted in an intra-capsular fracture. Proximal femoral fractures are often classified according to disruption of the capsular blood supply to the femoral head:\n• Intracapsular or sub-capital\n• Extracapsular: Intertrochanteric or sub-trochanteric\nThe anatomical shape of the hip (ball-and-socket joint) means that the stabilisers are essential. These include the following:\n1. Static stabilisers\na. Ligaments: Iliofemoral, pubofemoral, ischiofemoral\nb. Joint capsule\nc. Acetabular labrum: Fibro-cartilaginous triangular structure that surrounds the rim of the acetabulum, except at the inferior pole (transverse ligament)\n2. Dynamic stabilisers\na. Short external rotators\nb. Iliopsoas\nc. Hip abductors"

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "The hip joint reaction force is influenced by the patient's body weight and abductor muscle force. The abductor muscles provide the lever power that supports the pelvis against the fulcrum of the cup and socket of the hip joint. Both must be present and working normally for a patient to stand on one leg easily. For the following scenarios, the approximate joint reaction forces are:\n• Lifting leg from bed = 1.5 x body weight\n• Standing on one leg = 3-5 x body weight\n• Running and jumping = 10 x body weight\nJoint reaction force is reduced with a stick in the contralateral hand, as it reduces the abductor muscle force and the body weight moment arm."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Avascular necrosis (AVN), or osteonecrosis, of the femoral head is caused by disruption of the vascular supply leading to bone necrosis. Subsequent femoral head collapse and osteoarthritis occur. It is more common in males between the ages of 35 and 50 years. Bilateral occurrence is seen in 50%–80% of cases. Causes include the following:\n• Primary: Idiopathic e.g. Perthes disease\n• Secondary: Trauma or infection, drugs, e.g., steroids, alcohol excess, chronic liver disease, sickle cell disease, Caisson disease (the bends), radiotherapy, chemotherapy, SLE\nSmoking is not a recognised cause. Although some are initially asymptomatic, the onset of symptoms can be quite rapid, with groin pain, reduced range of movement (in particular, internal rotation) and reduced mobility. Primary investigation is with weight-bearing AP pelvis radiographs, with the classical findings being sclerosis, sub-chondral resorption or collapse (crescent sign), leading ultimately to head flattening, collapse and OA. The Steinberg modification of the Ficat classification is used, with MRI employed for early detection. In the pre-collapse stage, measures such as bisphosphonates or core decompression +/– bone grafting may be taken. When there is evidence of collapse, proximal femoral rotational osteotomy (<50% of head) or joint replacement are indicated."

Subchondral collapse is associated with avascular necrosis. Hip osteoarthritis is seen in 10%–25% of people over 65 years of age. The most classical presentation is of groin pain with radiation down the anterior thigh to the knee and reduced mobility. As the disease progresses, the pain goes from activity related to regular rest and night pain. A globally irritable hip with reduced range of movement is found on examination, with loss of internal rotation, leg length discrepancy (distinguish fixed flexion deformity with Thomas' test) and an antalgic gait. Blood tests are commonly normal. Treatment includes lifestyle modification such as regular exercise and weight loss, analgesics, e.g., NSAIDs, walking aids and joint replacement."

            "explanation": "Primary total hip replacement is one of the most successful operations in orthopaedics, with a patient satisfaction rate of 90%–95%. When obtaining consent from a patient, it is routine to discuss all severe complications and any other complications with a rate of more than 1%. Potential intra-operative complications include neurovascular injury (sciatic nerve <1%, femoral artery or vein <1%), femoral fracture (<1%), or retained cement. The postoperative complications of total hip replacement are found in Table 37.1. Death is a possibility for any major surgery, but the incidence is <1%. Leg-length discrepancy does occur, but is rarely more than 2 cm, and, certainly, 10 cm would be most unlikely. Compartment syndrome is not a routinely associated complication of total hip replacement, although a possible but rare complication of any major surgery."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "During the anterolateral approach to the hip for total hip replacement, the fibres of gluteus medius are split; with excessive splitting there may be the potential of causing damage to the superior gluteal nerve (L4-S1) that innervates gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and tensor fascia lata. Resulting loss of abductor muscle power will lead to a Trendelenburg gait. The nerve exits from the anterior sacral foramina (sacral plexus) then leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen superior to piriformis. The nerve passes ~4–5cm above the greater trochanter where it is at most risk."

            "explanation": "A. 7 Proximal femoral osteotomy\nA patient with a local area of collapse from Perthes' disease needs that damaged area to be moved out of the load-bearing area and replaced with healthy cartilage. The method of doing this is a rotation osteotomy. Osteotomies around the hip aim to redistribute the forces and load-bearing areas to avoid areas of high-point loading. This can be done through a combination of proximal femur and acetabular osteotomies.\nB. 5 High tibial osteotomy\nKnee osteoarthritis is associated with varus, or less commonly valgus, deformities of the knee leading to altered load bearing and worsening disease. Osteotomies aim to realign the joint mechanics for better distribution of the load through the joint. It can do this by changing the alignment of the knee so that the bulk of the load goes through the unaffected side. The most common osteotomy around the knee is a high tibial osteotomy (open or closing wedge) for varus knee osteoarthritis. In young and active patients, a knee replacement can be avoided or delayed. If there is good range of movement, then a high tibial osteotomy will retain that range of movement while unloading the arthritic side of the joint.\nC. 10 Unicompartmental knee replacement\nIn younger patients with intact ligaments (ACL essential), arthritis limited to the medial compartment and a varus or fixed flexion deformity of less than 15 degrees should be considered for a unicompartmental knee replacement.\nD. 9 Total hip replacement\nTotal hip replacement provides patient satisfaction in 90%–95% of cases, with good longevity. A variety of bearing surfaces (metal on polyethylene, ceramic on polyethylene, ceramic on ceramic) and fixation techniques (uncemented versus cemented) exist.\nE. 8 Total knee replacement\nFor conventional tricompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee, a standard total knee replacement (TKR) is the operation of choice. The aims of TKR include pain relief, mechanical realignment, balance of the collateral ligaments and normal patella-femoral tracking. Patient satisfaction is ~85%, with good longevity."
