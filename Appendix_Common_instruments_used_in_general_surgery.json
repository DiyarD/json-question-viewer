            "explanation": "This is a self-retaining three-bladed retractor used for operations on the sigmoid colon and rectum, such as upper end of APR, anterior resection or Hartmann's operation. With the patient in the Lloyd-Davies (lithotomy-Trendelenberg) position, the abdomen is opened. On opening the abdomen and performing a laparotomy, the patient is placed in the head-down position. The retractor is now inserted with only the two lateral blades to separate the wound edges. Next, the entire small bowel from the duodeno-jejunal flexure to the ileocaecal junction is packed away toward the head end with wet towels. Now the centre blade is applied to push the packs and keep them away from the site of operation. The three blades are available in different sizes to fit in with the build of the patient. The appropriate dissection is now commenced.\nThe Dyball retractor, which the assistant uses, is a very useful deep retractor in the latter stages of these operations to retract the urinary bladder or the uterus, or both, when dissecting in the region of the recto-vesical pouch or the pouch of Douglas."

            "explanation": "This is a self-retaining retractor devised for the perineal end of an APR. After applying a purse-string to the anus, the stitch is left long and held in a haemostat to apply traction during dissection. An elliptical incision is made around the anus. The incision is deepened into both ischiorectal fossa. Once the incision is deep enough, the retractor is applied with the pointed ends upward to separate the ischiorectal fat, providing a good view of the anorectum that is held by the purse-string on the haemostat. As the dissection proceeds, the retractor has to be repositioned."

For longer incisions where dissection is not too deep, two of these retractors can be used at either end of the wound. It is ideal for a groin dissection for varicose veins, inguinal or femoral hernia repairs and femoral emoblectomy. It retracts skin and subcutaneous tissue and needs replacing as the incision is deepened. McIndoe scissors is the ideal dissecting instrument in these operations."

It is the ideal retractor to use when doing a lymph node biopsy under local anaesthetic, usually without an assistant. As a self-retaining retractor, it will need repositioning during the operation. The jaws should be prised open gently, because the operation is under local anaesthetic. To dissect the lymph node the McIndoe scissors is the ideal instrument to use to create as minimal trauma as possible, thus not distorting the macroscopic feature of the node."

            "explanation": "A curved collar incision is made halfway between the thyroid cartilage and suprasternal notch. After cutting through skin and platysma, the upper flap is raised up to the thyroid cartilage and lower flap down to the suprasternal notch. After mobilisation of the two flaps is complete, the Joll self-retaining thyroid retractor is inserted. This is done by first placing wet swabs over the skin edges, and then applying the two clips of the retractor to the swab-covered skin edges. The central segment of the retractor is then unscrewed to separate the skin edges to obtain full exposure. After dealing with the middle thyroid vein/s, the superior pole is first mobilised and divided. The Kocher dissector is very useful for this manoeuvre. The dissector is used to perform blunt dissection in the upper pole and isolate the superior thyroid vessels. Once isolated, the dissector is pushed under the pedicle. A tie is then put through the eye of the dissector, which at this stage doubles as an aneurysm needle. The pedicle is thus tied three times as close to the gland as possible, so as not to damage the external laryngeal nerve. With the dissector under the tied pedicle, a fine knife is used to cut the pedicle, leaving two ties in the patient and one on the gland. Alternatively an aneurysm needle may be used to perform this step. Dissection in this operation is ideally carried out by McIndoe scissors."
