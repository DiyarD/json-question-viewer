            "explanation": "The kidneys are a pair of retroperitoneal organs lying on the posterior abdominal wall. The right kidney lies lower in the body in comparison with the left as a result of the liver, which due to its large size pushes the kidney down during development. Meanwhile, the renal hila of the left and right kidney lie above and below the transpyloric plane respectively, approximately 5 cm from the midline.\n\nThe kidneys have four covering layers, which are as follows (from most proximal, i.e. in contact with the kidney substance to distal):\n\n• Fibrous capsule\n• Peri-renal fat\n• Peri-renal/Gerota's fascia – a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the kidneys and adrenal glands. It is continuous with the fascia transversalis laterally.\n• Para-renal fat – the outermost covering layer of the kidney, forming part of the retroperitoneal fat.\n\nThe liver (more specifically the right lobe of the liver) forms the superior border/relation of the right kidney. It does not however form a covering layer of the kidney itself."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The ureters are a pair of muscular tubes that emerge from the hilum of each kidney and run vertically downwards behind the parietal peritoneum on the psoas muscle. The psoas muscle separates the ureter from the tips of the lumbar vertebrae transverse processes. Each ureter is approximately 25 cm in length and has three natural constrictions at the renal pelvis (pelvi-ureteric junction or PUJ), the pelvic brim and on joining the bladder itself (vesico-ureteric junction or VUJ). Within the pelvis, the ureter runs down the lateral wall in the region of the ischial spine, where it turns forward and enters at the lateral angle of the bladder.\n\nQuadratus lumborum is an intra-abdominal muscle that arises from aponeurotic fibres of the iliolumbar ligament and the iliac crest. It is involved in lateral flexion and extension of the vertebral column and fixes the ribs in forced expiration. In addition, it forms the posterolateral border of the kidney. Transversus abdominis is a muscle of the abdominal wall that also forms the posterolateral border of the kidney. Iliacus is a muscle of thigh flexion and lateral rotation found in the iliac fossa, lateral to the psoas muscle. Latissimus dorsi is a large muscle of the back that is involved in pulling the arm dorsally and caudally (backwards and downwards)."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "While an individual is at rest, the kidneys receive around 20% of the cardiac output via the renal arteries. The right renal artery lies posterior to the inferior vena cava and is longer than the left renal artery.\n\nThe renal artery divides into five segmental branches, each independently supplying a parenchymal zone unrelated to the anatomical arrangement of the pyramid and calyx (the base unit of the kidney). The areas supplied are the apical, upper, middle, lower and posterior zones. The segmental arteries are further divided into arcuate branches that run in the boundary between the kidney cortex and medulla. Finally, the arcuate arteries branch into smaller vessels that run up and down, parallel with the collecting tubules, and form the afferent artery to each glomerulus."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The urethra is a tubular structure that connects the bladder to the external environment in males and females alike. Although its main function is to excrete urine, in males, it has the added function of acting as a conduit for semen.\n\nIn females, the urethra is a short perineal structure approximately 3–5 cm in length, opening in the vulva between the clitoris and vagina. Given its short length and location in the perineum, females are especially prone to ascending urinary tract infections (UTIs).\n\nIn comparison, the male urethra is around 20 cm long and has five components. These are\n\n• Pre-prostatic or intramural urethra – Approximately 0.5–1.5 cm in length (varies according to bladder fullness).\n• Prostatic urethra – Approximately 3 cm in length and the widest/most dilatable part of the urethra. The vas deferens and prostatic ducts (contributing sperm and seminal fluid) open into this portion.\n• Membranous urethra – Approximately 2 cm long portion of the urethra piercing the urogenital diaphragm. It is also the narrowest part of the urethra.\n• Bulbar urethra.\n• Penile urethra – Runs along the ventral surface of the penis and is the longest portion, comprising most of the urethral length."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Renal tract stones (calculi) are common, affecting approximately 1%–2% of the adult population. They are more prevalent in young and middle-aged men and caused mainly by factors that increase urine solute concentration, e.g. calcium salts, urine concentration and urinary stasis. They can arise in any part of the urinary tract and present with intense colicky loin to groin pain, and are associated with nausea, vomiting and lower urinary tract symptoms.\n\nMost stones (approximately 90%) are formed of calcium oxalate and magnesium/calcium/ammonium phosphate (so-called triple phosphate stones). These substances are radio-opaque and as a result mostly seen on a plain KUB scan. Xanthine, uric acid and cysteine stones are rarer and usually the result of an acquired or genetic biochemical abnormality. These types of stones are generally radiolucent and therefore not seen on a KUB scan.\n\nInitial treatment consists of adequate analgesia, fluid rehydration (oral ± intravenous) and correcting any underlying abnormality that could predispose to stone formation. Further treatment depends on the size of the stone. Most calculi (95%) <5 mm in diameter will tend to pass spontaneously (although this can be painful). Patients can therefore be treated conservatively with fluid rehydration and analgesia. For calculi >5 mm in diameter or in individuals in whom pain is not resolving, further investigation may be needed, with treatment dependent on calculus size and location.\n\nApproximate frequency of stone types is\n\n• Xanthine – <1%\n• Cysteine – <2%\n• Uric acid – 5%\n• (Triple) phosphate (Mg2+, Ca2+, PO43-) – 33%\n• Calcium oxalate – 60%"

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Renal colic is the result of ureter spasm and hyper-peristalsis secondary to stone impaction in the urinary tract. Calculi impact at sites of narrowing in the ureter, which can be pathological in origin (e.g. strictures) or naturally occurring (e.g. the pelvi-ureteric junction, crossing of the ureter at the SIJ and at the vesico-ureteric junction).\n\nSeveral methods of imaging are available to visualize the renal tract and urinary calculi. Traditionally, the most frequently used technique has been an x-ray KUB (also called the control film) which visualizes the kidneys, ureters and bladder. It relies on the fact that more than 90% of urinary calculi are radio-opaque and will therefore appear on a plain radiograph. This is the correct answer here.\n\nIntravenous urography/pyelography is an X-ray technique consisting of a control film, i.e. taking a KUB and giving a contrast solution. Following contrast injection, another film is immediately taken followed by more radiographs at 20 and 60 minutes. An IVU will indicate the level of an obstruction, whether there is prevention of flow of contrast (seen as filling defect), or tumours in the bladder. Although an excellent technique, it is contraindicated in those with contrast allergy, poor renal function and diabetic patients taking metformin. It is incorrect in this scenario as there is no indication of a KUB having been taken already.\n\nDMSA and DTPA scans are used for cortical imaging and can give an estimate of renal function. They are not commonly used as first line imaging tools in cases of suspected renal tract stones. Ultrasound KUB is also a commonly used technique to determine acute obstruction and can detect some stones, but is generally unreliable for detecting ureteric calculi. More recently, many units have begun to use CT-KUB as a first line investigative tool, however this is not yet universal practice. Flexible cystoscopy is used to directly visualize the urethra, bladder and ureters. It is more commonly used as a minimally invasive method of stone removal in the presence of large renal tract stones or if conservative management of small stones is unsuccessful."

They are the result of repeated infection with organisms such as *Proteus*, *Pseudomonas*, *Staphylococcus*, *Mycoplasma* and *Klebsiella*. These are referred to as urea-splitting organisms as they hydrolyse urea to ammonium with a resulting alkalinization of urine.

Acute pyelonephritis occurs as a result of ascending infection of the urinary tract or septicaemia, leading to fever, rigours and loin pain as the classic triad of presentation. A variety of methods are used to investigate acute pyelonephritis including a urine dipstick test, as well as urine and blood cultures (to exclude a possible bacterial cause and direct treatment). Radiological investigations such as CT-KUB and ultrasound may demonstrate obstructing points indicative of renal stone disease, while an IVU can indicate kidney enlargement and poor urinary concentration.\n\nChronic pyelonephritis is the result of recurrent UTI and vesico-ureteric reflux. It is diagnosed by the radiological finding of a small, contracted, scarred and atrophic kidney. Occasionally, patients may present later with signs and features of chronic renal failure. Treatment is by addressing the underlying cause, correcting metabolic and renal abnormalities, antibiotics and occasionally nephrectomy in the presence of severely diseased kidneys."

            "explanation": "Fournier's gangrene is a relatively rare necrotizing fascitis of the perineal, perianal and genital areas (secondary to infection by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria), affecting predominantly middle-aged and elderly men with pre-existing co-morbidities (it is seen more frequently in diabetic patients). It is a urological emergency that often presents with swelling, pain and erythema of the genital region accompanied by systemic features such as fever and rigour. This is commonly preceded by a several-day history of pruritus and discomfort of the external genitalia. External necrotic areas may or may not be evident. The presence of perineal crepitus is virtually diagnostic. Given the potential for rapid spread and tissue destruction, early diagnosis and debridement is an essential component of management, along with broad-spectrum antibiotic cover. Mortality is high and related to the level of existing co-morbidity.\n\nProstatitis is an inflammation of the prostate gland related to bladder outflow obstruction that presents with frequency, urgency, dysuria and occasional haematuria (i.e. symptoms of a UTI) as well as fever, haemospermia and occasionally a tender prostate and pain on ejaculation. Treatment is with antibiotics and further investigations such as a trans-rectal ultrasound may be employed to rule out (and if necessary, drain) any abscess that has formed as a result of the inflammatory process. Testicular tumours, torsion and epididymo-orchitis are discussed elsewhere in this chapter."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Rhabdomyolysis is the destruction of striated muscle due to injury, which may be physical, chemical or biological in origin. Causative factors for rhabdomyolysis include:\n\n• Common causes e.g. crush injury, ischaemia, prolonged epileptic fits, heavy physical exercise (especially if dehydrated) and alcohol withdrawal.\n• Rare causes e.g. infection (viral necrotizing myositis), inflammatory myopathy (polymyositis), drugs (statins), hypothyroidism, snake bites, malignant hyperthermia and electric shock.\n\nThe presentation will be dependent on the cause, but may include pain, swelling and weakness of an obviously affected muscle in crush injury. Occasionally, this can cause compartment syndrome as surrounding tissues are compressed by swelling, requiring urgent fasciotomy. Patients may also present with nausea, confusion, disorientation, coma, hypotension and physiological shock due to volume depletion and metabolic disturbance.\n\nClassically, expected metabolic abnormalities are hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia and raised creatinine (indicative of acute renal failure), hypocalcaemia (from calcium binding to necrotic muscle), hyperphosphataemia (as a reaction to hypocalcaemia), raised creatine kinase (from muscle breakdown) and occasionally, deranged liver function tests. Furthermore, a urine dipstick test may reveal blood, which is confirmed as myoglobin on microscopy. Myoglobin can accumulate to form casts in renal tubules, leading to obstruction of urine flow and acute tubular necrosis. Myoglobinuria is also suggested by the presence of red-brown urine.\n\nInitial management consists of stabilizing the patient, followed by fluid resuscitation (for rehydration and prevention of myoglobin deposition and tubular necrosis) and catheterization (to monitor urine output and guide rehydration). Urine alkalization with isotonic sodium bicarbonate can be used to make myoglobin more soluble, but evidence for its overall benefit is limited. Electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hyperkalaemia, will need correction, given its potential to cause fatal arrhythmias. Dialysis can be used in severe cases."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Hypospadias is the name for the abnormal ventral opening of the urethral meatus along the urethral groove between the glans penis and the scrotum or perineum, occurring in around 1:125 births. The meatus opens on the glans penis in the majority of cases (so-called first-degree hypospadias) and usually causes little functional problem. Opening of the urethra on the shaft and scrotum/perineum (second- and third-degree hypospadias) can result in difficulty urinating, along with psychosexual and fertility problems, necessitating repair at a young age (usually between 9 and 18 months). Common methods of repair include:\n\n• Meatal advancement and glanuloplasty – Involving the creation of a new meatus and closure of the existing opening.\n• Mathieu flap – Used for proximal shaft hypospadias, creating a flap based on the ectopic meatus, which is folded over, and the remaining lateral flaps closed over the new urethra.\n\nEpispadias is a condition in which the urethral meatus opens on the dorsum of the penis. It results from failure of mid-line structures below the umbilicus to fuse and is associated with the split symphysis pubis, low umbilicus, bifid clitoris (in girls), undescended testes, bladder exstrophy and cloacal exstrophy (in rare cases). Phimosis is a contraction of the foreskin, preventing its retraction from the head of the penis. In infants, it is usually a physiological process due to adhesion of the prepuce to the glans penis. Pathological phimosis occurs usually in older children and adults as a result of a disease process or infection. Treatment depends on the extent of functional disability and the commonest surgical intervention is circumcision. Paraphimosis occurs when retracted foreskin is not fully replaced, resulting in a tight and irreducible band around the penis, e.g. after insertion of a urinary catheter. Chordee is a congenital abnormality in which the head of the penis curves down in a ventral direction. It is usually corrected surgically during infancy. Perineal urethra refers to a urethral opening in the perineum. It is most common in women."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Wilm's tumour (nephroblastoma) is a malignant tumour of embryonic origin, most commonly affecting children aged 3–4 years. It is associated with a gene mutation on chromosome 11 that leads to the loss of the tumour suppressor gene WT-1. Occasionally, Wilm's tumour may be associated with other systemic abnormalities such as WAGR syndrome (Wilm's tumour, aniridia (absence of the iris), genito-urinary abnormalities and mental retardation) or Denys–Drash syndrome (associated with hemi-hypertrophy), but most patients are otherwise healthy and present acutely with fever, abdominal swelling and haematuria.\n\nThe tumour is classified into four stages, depending on the extent of tumour spread:\n\n• Stage I - Disease is limited to the kidney and can be completely excised. It does not breach the renal capsule.\n• Stage II – Disease extends beyond the kidney but can be excised with no residual beyond the excision margin.\n• Stage III – There is an unresectable primary tumour with lymph node metastasis.\n• Stage IV - Distant metastases are present, especially in the lungs.\n\nTreatment is by surgical resection, which may be delayed to allow pre-resection chemotherapy. After resection, further chemotherapy may be required depending on the tumour stage. Disseminated disease, particularly lung secondaries, can be treated with radiotherapy. Five-year survival is dependent on tumour stage, but overall prognosis is excellent. Individuals with stage I/II disease (the most common presentation) have a >90% 5-year survival, those with stage III disease have a >80% 5-year survival, and finally patients with disseminated stage IV disease have an approximately 65% 5-year survival."

The serum potassium level is usually strictly controlled, but may be altered as a result of disease, physiological response or medication. Causes of low serum potassium include:\n\n• Diuretics, e.g. furosemide, bumetanide and ethacrynic acid, which are all loop diuretics that inhibit the Na+/K+/2Cl- symporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, resulting in reduced serum potassium levels\n• Vomiting and diarrhoea\n• Pyloric stenosis\n• Villous adenoma of the rectum\n• Intestinal fistula\n• Steroids/Cushing's syndrome (excess steroid production)\n• Conn's syndrome\n• Alkalosis\n\nHypokalaemia may present asymptomatically or with muscle weakness, hypotonia, cramp, tetany and potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias (this is in common with hyperkalaemia).\n\nECG changes in hypokalaemia are small or inverted T waves, prominent U waves, prolonged PR interval, ST segment depression and a prolonged QT interval. Although left bundle branch block may occur in hypertension, it is not classically associated with hypokalaemia. ECG changes in hyperkalaemia include tall (tented) T waves, small P waves and wide QRS complexes.\n\nTreatment of hypokalaemia involves removing any causative agents and treating underlying conditions. For acute cases, oral or intravenous potassium supplementation is indicated with slow correction in order to prevent possible overload and arrhythmias."

In the majority of patients, however, the disease is an incidental finding (~50%) or associated with signs of systemic illness, e.g. weight loss, anaemia. Some patients may present with paraneoplastic syndromes indicative of disseminated disease. This will include release of renin, erythropoietin, ACTH or parathyroid-like hormone and will cause, among other symptoms, hypercalcaemia, polycythaemia, hypertension and night sweats. Metastatic spread of the disease is by direct extension into the paranephric fat, fascia and into the renal vein/inferior vena cava; or haematogenous, presenting as cannonball metastases in the lung, brain and bone.\n\nTreatment is dependent on stage and spread of disease. Localized disease is treated mainly with radical nephrectomy. This involves removal of the kidney and surrounding Gerota's fascia via either an extra-peritoneal lateral loin approach or trans-abdominal approach. A partial nephrectomy may be performed in certain cases, e.g. poor renal function. Treatment for metastatic disease (which affects around 30% of patients on initial presentation) includes palliative nephrectomy, embolization, chemo/radiotherapy and immunotherapy.\n\nFive-year survival is dependent on tumour stage and grade.

            "explanation": "Testicular malignancy is the commonest solid tumour in young men, but accounts for approximately 1%–2% of all male cancers in the United Kingdom. Individuals with undescended testicles, infertile parents and a previous contralateral malignancy are at an increased risk.\n\nTesticular tumours are divided into three broad groups: stromal tumours, lymphomas and germ cell tumours. Stromal tumours are those arising from Leydig's cells (which secrete androgens and can cause infantile Hercules' syndrome) and Sertoli's cells (these secrete androgens and individuals can present with testicular feminization). Approximately 10% are malignant. Lymphomas account for <10% of testicular tumours, occurring predominantly in elderly men, and have a poor prognosis.\n\nGerm cell tumours comprise the majority of testicular tumours (80%–90%) and are subdivided into two main types: seminomas and non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. Seminomas arise from germinal cells in the testes and are solid and slow growing. They comprise approximately 42% of germ cell tumours and are extremely radiosensitive, giving an excellent prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of around 90%. NSGCTs account for almost 60% of germ cell tumours and also have many subtypes of which teratomas are the most common. Teratomas usually affect individuals aged 15–35 years and are believed to originate from totipotent cells. They can be solid or cystic in nature.\n\nMost patients will present with a painless lump in the testicle although a small proportion may present with testicular pain. Occasionally, patients will complain of haematospermia and gynaecomastia (as a result of β-hCG production). Infrequently, patients will present with signs of disseminated disease such as shortness of breath, bone pain and a palpable abdominal mass (due to enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes). These malignancies can also produce tumour markers including AFP and β-hCG. Both markers are produced by teratomas whereas seminomas may produce AFP alone. Treatment is dependent on the type, grade and stage of the malignancy, and includes radical orchidectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Seminoma is a type of germ cell tumour of the testicle, predominantly affecting individuals aged 20–40 years. Vascular supply to the testicles is from the testicular artery, a branch of the abdominal aorta that travels through the inguinal canal to reach the testicles. Lymphatic drainage of the testicles follows the arterial supply back to the aorta and as a result initial dissemination of testicular malignancies is in the para-aortic lymph nodes.\n\nThe anterior cervical chain of nodes lies above and below the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck and drains the throat, posterior pharynx, tonsils and thyroid gland. Meanwhile, the posterior cervical chain lies posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscle (and anterior to the trapezius) and can become enlarged during upper respiratory tract infections. The superficial inguinal lymph nodes drain lymph from the scrotum, while the deep nodes can become enlarged as a result of spread from anal and vulval malignancies. The deep nodes drain to the external iliac, pelvic and finally para-aortic lymph nodes."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Carcinoma of the penis is a rare squamous cell carcinoma originating predominantly in the glans penis or foreskin and accounting for around 1% of male malignancy. It is extremely rare in individuals circumcised at a young age and thought to result from chronic irritation due to balanitis and smegma. Incidence is also higher in individuals with HPV infection (particularly serotypes 16, 18 and 31).\n\nPatients usually present with a painless lesion (an erythematous indurated area, ulcer or wart) on the glans, prepuce or foreskin. Patients will often delay consulting a medical practitioner, and as a result may have palpable inguinal lymph nodes at the time of initial presentation.\n\nThe disease is staged by the TNM classification, with treatment being dependent on staging. Local disease may be treated simply with local biopsy or circumcision, while more advanced disease may require topical chemotherapy (e.g. with 5-fluorouracil) or even partial or total amputation of the penis if there is poorly differentiated or locally advanced disease. Patients with palpable inguinal lymph nodes may or may not have disseminated disease. Antibiotic therapy is used to treat the underlying infection that could be confounding an individual's presentation. If lymph nodes remain palpable despite treatment, then bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy with *en bloc* dissection may be needed to clear the disease.\n\nThe 80% 5-year survival is dependent on tumour stage and the presence of metastatic disease. Overall survival is approximately 50%, but can be as low as 20% in patients with iliac node involvement or as high as 90% in those with only local disease without metastatic spread."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Peyronie's disease is an eponymously named connective tissue disorder of unknown origin, resulting in growth of fibrous plaques in the tunica albuginea and the corpus cavernosum. The disease affects approximately 1% of mainly middle-aged men, causing the penis to curve abnormally on erection (at the point at which fibrous plaques are present), and resulting in pain. The presence of pain and abnormal penile curvature can make sexual intercourse difficult and lead to erectile dysfunction. The condition is also associated with Dupuytren's and plantar fascial contractures.\n\nTreatment is initially conservative for 1 year to allow the disease process and pain to stabilize. ESWL can be used to soften or destroy the penile plaque, but there haven't been any long-term follow-up studies of this procedure.\n\nSurgical management is generally considered after 1 year especially if the condition is causing sexual dysfunction. Three main procedures are used:\n\n• Nesbit's operation – Tunica albuginea on the opposite side of the offending plaque is excised, leading to return of normal curvature but also penile shortening.\n• Plaque excision and patching – Can lead to softer erections.\n• Implantation of penile prosthesis – Straightens penis in men with pre-existing erectile dysfunction."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This scenario describes a case of BPH. The prostate gland is composed primarily of glandular tissue, with fibromuscular stroma contributing the rest of its mass. It is composed of three lobes (anterior, posterior and median) formed by four tissue layers:\n\n• Transition zone – Innermost tissue layer of the prostate that surrounds the urethra proximal to the ejaculatory ducts and is enlarged in BPH, leading to the associated signs and symptoms described.\n• Central zone – Surrounds the ejaculatory ducts and projects beneath the bladder to the seminal vesicles.\n• Peripheral zone – Most cancers of the prostate arise here (causing the bulky and the irregular prostate to be palpable on rectal examination).\n• Anterior fibromuscular stroma.\n\nBenign prostatic hypertrophy is the benign enlargement of stromal and glandular tissue within the inner transition zone of the prostate gland. This process is thought to result from a steroid hormone imbalance causing a proportionately increased level of oestrogen as compared with testosterone within the body. As a result, the elevated levels of oestrogen inhibit the elimination of DHT from the prostate. It is more common in middle-aged and elderly individuals, affecting most men by the age of 80. Presentation can be asymptomatic, i.e. found coincidentally, with lower urinary tract symptoms (which may develop over weeks or months) or urinary retention.\n\nLower urinary tract symptoms include:\n\n• Voiding symptoms, e.g. hesitancy, straining, poor stream, terminal dribbling and strangury (the sensation of incomplete voiding).\n• Storage symptoms, e.g. frequency, urgency, nocturia, overflow incontinence.\n• Other symptoms – UTI, bladder stones due to stasis, occasional haematuria.\n\nPhysical examination may reveal a palpable, enlarged bladder, which may also cause pain. This must be relieved by urinary or suprapubic catheterization. In addition, a digital rectal examination will reveal a smoothly enlarged prostate but this does not always correlate with the patient's symptoms. Key investigations in addition to routine blood tests are PSA level, although this is not specific for investigation of LUTS, and ultrasound scan of the renal tract, to rule out any other abnormalities."
