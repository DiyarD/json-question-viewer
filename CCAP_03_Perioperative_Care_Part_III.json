            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Perioperative HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) should be continued perioperatively for patients using them chronically.\n- Statin continuation within 24 hours of elective surgery decreases all-cause mortality, especially due to cardiac events in patients undergoing noncardiac operations.\n- This effect is not solely due to the lipid-lowering effects of statins; the anti-inflammatory properties appear to primarily provide protection.\n- Although the benefits of continuing statins perioperatively are most marked in the reduction of cardiac events, there are also observed decreases in infectious-related complications, renal failure, and respiratory complications.\n- There is no apparent effect on central nervous system complications.\n- Patients younger than 75, patients with heart disease or diabetes, or patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures are at most risk, and perioperative statins should be continued if possible."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs in approximately 1:1000 general-risk and 1:100 high-risk patients and can result in pulmonary embolism.\n- Anticoagulation remains the most common prophylactic and treatment method, yet it is contraindicated in patients with recent hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, undergoing high-risk surgical procedures, or who have sustained severe trauma.\n- In these patients, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters can afford protection from pulmonary embolism from lower extremity deep vein thromboses (DVTs).\n- Absolute indications for placement of these filters are recurrent VTE despite adequate anticoagulation, contraindication to anticoagulation, complications resulting from anticoagulation, and inability to maintain or achieve appropriate anticoagulation.\n- Relative indications include recurrent pulmonary embolism, free-floating lower extremity DVT, and iliocaval DVT.\n- Prophylactic IVC filters are the most common indication (58%) for placement and can be used in trauma, surgical, or medical patients at high risk for DVT.\n- IVC filter placement is most commonly performed via femoral vein approach.\n- Overall complications are low. Early (<30 days) complications (e.g., hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, oversedation) occur in 7%.\n- Long-term complications include recurrent DVT (20%), stent migration (1.3%), and thrombosis (2.8%).\n- Long-term complications should be avoidable because most IVC filters are removable.\n- The current problem is that only 35 to 40% of IVC filters are removed.\n- It is incumbent on all healthcare providers to be aware of this problem and to make sure filters are removed as soon as medically indicated."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Low pelvic anastomoses for rectal cancer are associated with anastomotic leak rates of 10 to 20%, with the number being higher as the anastomosis gets lower in the pelvis.\n- These leaks can lead to severe pelvic sepsis and death.\n- Most surgeons routinely protect low pelvic anastomoses with a loop ileostomy.\n- Whether temporary proximal diversion truly reduces leak rates or simply reduces the clinical impact of leaks, including a less frequent need for surgical re-exploration, is controversial.\n- Low pelvic anastomotic repair and salvage is quite difficult at the time of diagnosis.\n- Unprotected anastomoses that leak often require takedown and permanent fecal diversion.\n- This patient had an anastomotic leak, but it was diverted proximally, is clinically normal with no uncontrolled sepsis after a percutaneous drain created a controlled colocutaneous fistula.\n- Most of these fistulas (~75%) will close spontaneously over time and not require surgical intervention, but they can take up to 6 months to heal.\n- During this time, observation and ongoing percutaneous drainage are typically all that is necessary without a need for antibiotics or bowel rest.\n- The anastomosis is followed with serial water-soluble contrast enemas or CT scans with rectal contrast.\n- Bowel rest and parenteral nutrition will not affect the output or closure rate of a diverted fistula and may lead to malnutrition and bacterial overgrowth.\n- Endoscopic injection of fibrin glue was reported in a small series with limited success, but this would typically be reserved for patients with persistent fistulas rather than used as a primary intervention.\n- Laparotomy with repair of the anastomotic defect would be aggressive and technically difficult, and such a repair, when warranted, would be better approached transanally.\n- Laparotomy would be appropriate for uncontrolled sepsis, especially if the patient was not initially diverted.\n- Anastomotic resection and end colostomy should be reserved for patients with severe anastomotic breakdown and associated pelvic sepsis."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Up to 17% of patients treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) will develop anti-heparin-PF4 antibodies (also known as HIT antibodies).\n- Less than 5% of these patients go on to develop the syndrome of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).\n- Antibody formation is lower in patients treated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, 8%), and the relative risk of thrombotic complications is 0.22 compared with UFH.\n- Despite its rarity, HIT remains quite morbid, and early recognition and treatment are essential to good patient outcomes.\n- Although significant variation exists in timing and severity, HIT typically occurs 5 to 15 days after initial heparin exposure.\n- New-onset thrombocytopenia should alert the clinician that heparin cessation and HIT antibody testing are necessary.\n- The \"4T\" score (thrombocytopenia, timing of platelet decrease, sequela of thrombosis, and other causes of thrombocytopenia) is used at many centers to differentiate patients into either low risk or intermediate-to-high risk for HIT.\n- Patients with HIT can develop both arterial and venous thromboses.\n- Prompt anticoagulation with a novel agent is warranted.\n- Direct thrombin inhibitors such as argatroban and bivalirudin are considered first-line therapy for HIT.\n- Desmopressin is used for patients with von Willebrand disease and has not been studied in HIT.\n- Transfused platelets would be counterproductive in preventing thrombotic complications.\n- Enoxaparin is associated with HIT as well and is not used due to concern for cross-reactivity.\n- Warfarin is not used for HIT due to its slow rate of onset along with the associated transient hypercoagulability, with several reports of warfarin-induced skin necrosis being tied to HIT treatment."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Methemoglobinemia is a well-known but uncommon complication of topical benzocaine, occurring in 1 of every 7000 exposures.\n- It is caused by mucosal absorption of benzocaine, which can lead to the oxidation of ferrous (Fe2+) to ferric (Fe3+) iron.\n- Iron in hemoglobin must be in its reduced (Fe2+) state for normal oxygen exchange to occur.\n- This oxidation of hemoglobin not only leads to a functional anemia but also increases its affinity for oxygen, thus shifting the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left and leading to less oxygen delivery to tissues.\n- Patients with methemoglobinemia will become increasingly cyanotic as methemoglobin levels increase.\n- The cyanosis is typically unresponsive to supplemental oxygen.\n- Pulse oximetry will generally underestimate the degree of hypoxia, with readings of 85 to 90% despite a worsening clinical picture.\n- Of note, the PaO2 will be elevated and the blood will often have a dark brown hue.\n- Methylene blue acts as an electron donor, converting methemoglobin back to hemoglobin.\n- It should be administered at an initial dose of 50 to 100 mg intravenously.\n- If patients do not improve after administration, there are several possibilities, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and even methylene blue overdose, which causes worsening methemoglobin at very high doses because it is also an oxidizing agent.\n- Patients with refractory methemoglobinemia can be considered for exchange transfusions or hyperbaric oxygen.\n- Flumazenil is the primary pharmacologic treatment for benzodiazepine overdose, whereas naloxone is used for narcotic overdose.\n- Dantrolene is administered for malignant hyperthermia.\n- Endotracheal intubation would be appropriate if the sedated patient could not protect his airway, but it would not improve the patient's oxygenation in the presence of high levels of methemoglobin."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols for patients undergoing colorectal surgery are derived from studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions designed to reduce the morbidity and cost of surgical procedures and therefore improve outcomes and value.\n- One such intervention, providing sugar-free chewing gum perioperatively, is as a method of sham feeding, with the hope that the mastication motion will promote intestinal motility through the cephalic phase of vagal enteric stimulation.\n- A meta-analysis summarizing the existing literature concluded that sugar-free chewing gum is an inexpensive and effective way to reduce postoperative ileus, and it is well-tolerated without any detrimental effect on patient outcomes.\n- Methylnaltrexone is currently indicated for opioid-induced constipation, but it was initially studied as an intervention to reduce postoperative ileus. Two large multicenter randomized controlled trials failed to show a reduction in postoperative ileus compared with placebo.\n- Liposomal bupivacaine is gaining in popularity as a component of multimodal pain control in ERAS protocols. However, current data do not demonstrate superiority to conventional bupivacaine.\n- Laxatives such as magnesium citrate and stimulants such as bisacodyl will induce diarrhea, but they will not increase small intestinal motility or reduce postoperative ileus."

Also, there are no data confirming any reduction in morbidity and mortality for its use in renal failure.\n- Aggressive diuretic therapy used in the early stages of AKI to treat volume overload and hyperkalemia is possible. However, once a patient advances to renal failure, renal replacement therapy is the preferred modality of management.\n- Low-dose dopamine infusions were once erroneously thought to be renal protective via a mechanism of increased renal blood flow. There are currently no data to support the use of a dopamine infusion as prevention or treatment of AKI."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Patients with atrial fibrillation are placed on lifelong anticoagulation to reduce their risk of embolic stroke.\n- When they are scheduled to undergo surgery, most patients have their warfarin held preoperatively, typically 5 days before surgery.\n- Due to the concern of an embolic event during this time period, many patients undergo bridging anticoagulation with a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\n- Despite very little data to support this practice, bridging anticoagulation has remained in practice guidelines.\n- A prospective, double blind, randomized trial of 1884 low-risk patients compared bridging with LMWH with no bridging in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who had warfarin held in the perioperative period.\n- The incidence of arterial thromboembolism and stroke was not different between the 2 groups (0.4% vs 0.3%) but the patients who underwent bridging with LMWH had more than twice as much major bleeding (1.3% vs 3.2%).\n- Given no increase in stroke rate but higher bleeding complications in the bridging group, perioperative bridging anticoagulation is not recommended.\n- The risk of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation can be calculated with the CHADS2 score.\n- The CHADS2 score is calculated by adding up points from the presence of congestive heart failure, hypertension, age older than 75 years, diabetes mellitus, and history of stroke or transient ischemic attack.\n- The patient in our question has 2 points for hypertension and diabetes, giving him a 4.0% yearly risk of thromboembolic event with no warfarin.\n- Dual antiplatelet therapy is not an effective treatment to prevent stroke in patient with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation."

At the same time, there is also no significant detriment to continuing calcium channel blocker therapy on the day of surgery, and the decision of whether to continue can be left to the discretion of the surgical team and patient.\n- Similarly, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are commonly prescribed medications. Use of ACE inhibitors on the day of surgery is associated with intraoperative hypotension but does not cause worse cardiovascular or renal outcomes.\n- Meanwhile, there is no convincing evidence that perioperative use of ACE inhibitors is protective. Thus, ACC/AHA recommendations suggest that it is reasonable to continue ACE inhibitor therapy in the perioperative period but holding them is acceptable as well.\n- There is a similar concern that loop diuretics used on the day of noncardiac surgery could increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension; however, the risk of developing perioperative adverse cardiovascular events is not increased in patients on continued furosemide therapy. In these patients, however, there is no known benefit to continued therapy.\n- Alpha-2 agonists are not recommended as cardiac prophylaxis in patients who are undergoing noncardiac surgery, because they have no role in perioperative cardiac protection and may increase postoperative nonfatal myocardial infarction.\n- Sudden discontinuation of ongoing alpha-2 agonist therapy can result in hypertension, headache, or agitation, but continuation on the day of surgery is not proven to provide perioperative benefit."

Mechanical prophylaxis is recommended for all bariatric surgical patients, along with early ambulation.\n- In addition, most data suggest benefit for the combined use of mechanical and chemoprophylaxis in these patients.\n- Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters, particularly when retrievable, were of interest, especially in the high-risk bariatric population.\n- They offer a potentially reversible, effective mode of VTE prophylaxis that obviates the risk of anticoagulation.\n- A systematic review of IVC filter placement in bariatric surgery patients found an overall higher risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients receiving a preoperative filter.\n- IVC filters are associated with multiple device-related complications, including filter migration, thrombosis, embolization, occlusion, and fracture.\n- In addition, prophylactic placement of IVC filters does not decrease the use of anticoagulation, mortality, or length of stay."

            "question": "A 44-year-old man presents with a history of sigmoid colon stricture and colovesical fistula due to complicated diverticulitis. He underwent preoperative epidural analgesia with morphine and bupivacaine. His procedure was a laparoscopic-converted-to-open sigmoid colectomy with stapled colorectal end-to-end anastomosis in modified lithotomy position. Intraoperative findings were a large inflammatory mass densely adherent to the posterior wall of the bladder, small bowel, retroperitoneum, and sacral promontory. Immediately postoperatively, he complained of left lower extremity weakness in the femoral nerve distribution and decreased motor function. The next immediate step in management is",

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- When a patient develops lower extremity weakness immediately postoperatively with an epidural catheter in place, evaluation for possible epidural hematoma should be the first priority.\n- The optimal diagnostic test for epidural hematoma is an urgent MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spine.\n- In a single-institution study of 43,200 epidural catheterizations, 102 patients underwent spine MRI that confirmed 6 cases of epidural hematoma (overall incidence 1 per 10,000 epidural blocks).\n- This patient had femoral neuropathy from deep pelvis surgery. The mechanism is compression of the femoral nerve against the pelvic sidewall as the nerve emerges from the border of the psoas muscle before exiting the pelvis at the inguinal ligament due to self-retaining retractors.\n- Risk factors for femoral nerve compression include the following: thin subcutaneous fat layer (BMI <20), operating time greater than 4 hours, narrow pelvis, and self-retaining retractors, with extreme lateral traction.\n- In a study of 2304 patients who underwent major colorectal surgery at a single institution, peripheral nerve injury occurred in 0.2% (5/2211) of open procedures and 3% (3/93) of laparoscopic procedures. There was no association between age, sex, operative time, BMI, or American Society of Anesthesiologists score and nerve injury.\n- Nerves are prone to stretching or compression in the lithotomy position. The most common nerves affected are (1) femoral and (2) lateral femoral cutaneous.\n- In patients undergoing gynecologic pelvic surgery, a 2% incidence has been reported, with 91% complete resolution at a median time of 31.5 days.\n- To minimize nerve trauma in the lithotomy position, the following should be considered: minimize abduction and external hip rotation; pad all areas at risk for tissue injury: hips, lateral fibulas, posterior thighs, and heels; ensure that hips and knees are moderately flexed and securely supported; direct the weight of the lower extremities toward the soles of the feet; avoid lower extremity tissue injury by ensuring that the stirrup edges do not cut into the calf (e.g., peroneal nerve), posterior thigh, or low on the Achilles tendon; use shorter blades and periodic relief of pressure with self-retaining retractors."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated to prevent stent thrombosis in patients with coronary stents.\n- When these patients need surgery, decisions regarding perioperative antiplatelet therapy should be based on the bleeding risk of the planned procedure, risk of stent thrombosis, and alternative options.\n- This patient underwent drug-eluting stent placement 6 months ago. Modification of dual antiplatelet therapy is appropriate and safe at this time with the risk of stent thrombosis being acceptably low.\n- The risk of a bleeding complication on clopidogrel is sufficient that discontinuation in the perioperative period is indicated.\n- Aspirin can be safely continued.\n- Because of the underlying malignant diagnosis, delaying the operation is not appropriate.\n- Bridging with enoxaparin will not provide additional benefit."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Postoperative venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality.\n- The Caprini score stratifies patients into very low (0 points), low (1-2 points), moderate (3-4 points), and high (>5 points) risk of VTE to determine type and duration of prophylaxis.\n- High-risk patients should undergo chemoprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\n- High-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery for malignancy have the highest risk for postoperative VTE.\n- Two randomized trials demonstrated reduced VTE rates in these patients with 4 weeks of LMWH chemoprophylaxis compared with 1 week.\n- The American College of Chest Physicians Chest Guidelines for prevention of VTE in nonorthopedic surgical patients state, \"For patients at high risk for VTE undergoing abdominal or pelvic surgery for cancer, we recommend extended-duration, postoperative, pharmacologic prophylaxis (4 weeks) with LMWH over limited-duration prophylaxis (Grade 1B).\"\n- Shorter durations of VTE pharmacologic prophylaxis such as \"only while hospitalized\" or \"until back to baseline ambulatory status\" are inadequately short.\n- Four weeks' duration is not associated with increased bleeding complications; however, extending duration of chemoprophylaxis beyond 4 weeks does increase the risk of bleeding complications without providing additional benefit in reducing VTE."
