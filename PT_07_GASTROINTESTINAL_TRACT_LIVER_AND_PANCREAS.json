            "explanation": "*   Omeprazole (Prilosec) irreversibly inhibits the hydrogen-potassium-ATPase (proton pump) in the secretory canaliculus of the gastric parietal cell.\n*   This blocks the last step in the acid-secretory process.\n*   Omeprazole's duration of action exceeds 24 hours, and doses of 20–30 mg per day inhibit more than 90% of 24-hour acid secretion.\n*   It provides excellent suppression of meal-stimulated and nocturnal acid secretion.\n*   It seems very safe for short-term therapy.\n*   However, its safety for long-term use is uncertain since it produces significant hypergastrinemia, hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells, and carcinoid tumors in laboratory animals with prolonged administration."

            "explanation": "*   The diagnosis of bleeding esophageal varices in adults is aided by stigmata of portal hypertension.\n*   Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in cirrhotics is due to esophageal varices in less than half of patients; gastritis and peptic ulcer disease account for the majority of cases.\n*   Esophagoscopy is the single most reliable means of establishing the source of bleeding, though variations in transvariceal blood flow may result in nonvisualization of the varices.\n*   Endoscopic sclerotherapy is reported to control acute variceal hemorrhage in 80–90% of cases and carries a lower acute mortality than other procedures.\n*   Barium swallow has a high false negative rate and offers no therapeutic advantage.\n*   Celiac angiography will rule out arterial hemorrhage and demonstrate venous collateral circulation but will not demonstrate variceal bleeding.\n*   Parenteral vasopressin controls variceal hemorrhage by constriction of the splanchnic arteriolar bed and a resultant drop in portal pressure.\n*   Intraarterial vasopressin offers no advantage over intravenous administration and requires a mesenteric catheter; the reported control rate is 50–70%.\n*   Esophageal balloon tamponade controls variceal hemorrhage in two-thirds of patients but may also control bleeding ulcers, thereby obscuring the diagnosis.\n*   Although balloon tamponade has reduced mortality and morbidity from variceal hemorrhage in good-risk patients, increased awareness of associated complications (aspiration, asphyxiation, and ulceration at the tamponade site), as well as a rebleeding rate of 40%, has reduced its use.\n*   It is indicated as a temporary measure when vasopressin and sclerotherapy fail.\n*   Emergency portacaval shunt is advised in good-risk cirrhotic patients whose bleeding is not controlled with vasopressin or sclerosis.\n*   The mortality for patients with bleeding varices not subjected to shunting is between 66 and 73%, whereas operative mortality of emergency shunts ranges from 20 to 50%.\n*   Esophageal transection with the autostapler carries the same mortality as shunt procedures, and the rebleeding rate is estimated to be 50% at 1 year."

A 28-year-old previously healthy woman arrives in the emergency room complaining of 24 h of anorexia and nausea and lower abdominal pain that is more intense in the right lower quadrant than elsewhere. On examination she has peritoneal signs of the right lower quadrant and a rectal temperature of 38.38°C (101.8°F). At exploration through incision of the right lower quadrant, she is found to have a small, contained perforation of a cecal diverticulum. Which of the following statements regarding this situation is true?",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "*   Cecal diverticula must be differentiated from the more common variety of diverticula usually found in the left colon.\n*   Cecal diverticula are thought to be a congenital entity.\n*   The cecal diverticulum is often solitary and involves all layers of the bowel wall; therefore, cecal diverticula are true diverticula.\n*   Diverticula elsewhere in the colon are almost always multiple and are thought to be an acquired disorder, which are really herniations of mucosa through weakened areas of the muscularis propria of the colon wall.\n*   The preoperative diagnosis in the case of cecal diverticulitis is \"acute appendicitis\" about 80% of the time.\n*   If there is extensive inflammation involving much of the cecum, an ileocolectomy is indicated.\n*   If the inflammation is well localized to the area of the diverticulum, a simple diverticulectomy with closure of the defect is the procedure of choice.\n*   To avoid diagnostic confusion in the future, the appendix should be removed whenever an incision is made in the right lower quadrant, unless operatively contraindicated."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "*   Hepatic hemangiomata are the most common of all liver tumors.\n*   Infantile forms are highly vascular and occasionally cause hepatomegaly or congestive cardiac failure requiring angiographic or surgical interruption.\n*   The diagnostic incidence of incidental cavernous hemangiomata in adults has increased with noninvasive imaging (MRI, ultrasonography, CT).\n*   When suspected, diagnosis can be confirmed with sensitive and more specific imaging techniques such as labeled red blood cell scanning (not liver/spleen scans).\n*   The mean age of presentation in adults is about 50 years, and the vast majority of these lesions are asymptomatic.\n*   There is no evidence that they undergo malignant transformation.\n*   They may enlarge and become symptomatic more readily in women after multiple pregnancies or during the use of estrogen or oral contraceptives.\n*   The risk of rupture and severe hemorrhage into or from hemangiomata is extremely low; when it does occur, it is usually iatrogenic (following attempted biopsy).\n*   Given the typically benign and static nature of these lesions, management by angiographic embolization or resection should be reserved for the rare patient with symptomatic or complicated hemangioma."

            "explanation": "*   CEA is a nonspecific tumor marker described in 1965 by Gold and Freedman.\n*   It is elevated in only about one-half of patients with colorectal tumors and is often elevated in patients with lung, pancreatic, gastric, and gynecologic malignancies.\n*   CEA is also elevated in cigarette smokers.\n*   Patients in whom the primary colon tumor produced CEA and whose level falls below 2–3 ng/mL after resection have an excellent prognosis for disease control.\n*   In such patients, a subsequent rise in CEA has been demonstrated to be a very sensitive marker of the presence and extent of recurrent disease.\n*   Many surgeons follow CEA levels and perform \"second-look\" operations to resect local disease or possibly isolated metastatic disease if levels become elevated postoperatively.\n*   Some surgeons recommend exploration in that circumstance even without other evidence (CT scan, colonoscopy) of recurrence.\n*   Long-term survival seems to be improved following this aggressive approach in some patients.\n*   Very high elevations of CEA, however, suggest extensive liver disease or peritoneal spread, which is unresectable."
