            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The thyroid gland has a rich lymphatic supply and drains primarily to the central compartment or level VI nodes. These can be further subdivided in to prelaryngeal (Delphian nodes), pretracheal and paratracheal regions. Although most lesions of the thyroid drain to these regions, occasionally drainage from the upper poles can be to the parapharyngeal region. Papillary thyroid cancer (the most common malignancy of the thyroid) metastasises often and early, so many nodes in central and lateral compartments of the neck may be involved, although this is not always obvious on clinical examination or even imaging. Interestingly, even though micrometastases are present in up to 40% of patients considered free of disease, micrometastases rarely progress to cause clinical recurrence and therefore elective neck dissection is not routinely advocated."

Abnormal TSH receptor antibodies produce a disproportionate and prolonged effect. It can be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes, pernicious anaemia and coeliac disease. Toxic nodular goitre is often seen in middle age or in the elderly and is rarely associated with eye signs. A solitary toxic nodule is often autonomous and its hypertrophy or hyperplasia is not associated with TSH receptor antibodies. Thyroid cancer very rarely presents as hyperthyroidism. Thyroid inflammation, especially postpartum, can cause hyperthyroidism."

However, rarely, relapses are corrected with medication. Large goitres, younger patients and very elevated fT3 and fT4 rarely benefit from medical management. A toxic nodule is autonomous in nature and will relapse if medications are stopped. Agranulocytosis occurs in only 0.1%-0.5% of patients on antithyroid drugs.

The annual incidence of thyroid cancer is increasing rapidly. This is thought to be due to rising use of imaging rather than a true increase in incidence of disease. The female:male sex ratio of differentiated thyroid cancer is 3:1. It is most common in adults ages 40–50. Anaplastic carcinoma presents in older patients and might be due to de-differentiation of prior differentiated thyroid cancer.

The aim of therapy for high-risk differentiated thyroid cancer is to render the patient without detectable thyroglobulin. To achieve this, total thyroidectomy and appropriate neck dissection should be performed. Postoperative radioactive iodine therapy will then be used to destroy microscopic deposits of normal and malignant thyroid tissue. Thyroglobulin can then be used as an effective tumour marker, particularly in the absence of autoantibodies, which can interfere. For lower-risk patients, lobectomy alone will be appropriate. In this setting thyroglobulin never becomes undetectable, but trends can be followed to indicate possible recurrence."

Despite the rates of metastasis, this does not predict survival. Indeed, early studies suggested that regional metastases might actually be protective. Experience, however, has shown that this was due to the fact that young patients tend to present with neck nodes, and age is the strongest predictor of all. Central neck metastases do not predict survival. Lateral neck metastases, however, particularly in older patients, are more predictive. Follicular cancer and the associated Hurthle cell carcinoma arise from thyroid epithelium. They more commonly spread via the haematogenous route than papillary cancers."

            "explanation": "This is a controversial subject. When a preoperative diagnosis has been made, the patient should have ultrasound screening of the neck at least. If there is widespread nodal metastases, cross-sectional imaging is encouraged to visualise the extent of disease and in particular the mediastinum, which is poorly seen on ultrasound. Small, low-risk tumours (<1 cm) are well treated by lobectomy alone. Most international guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy if tumours are >1 cm or have any risk factors such as nodal metastases. Although papillary cancers routinely metastasise to the central and lateral neck, if these metastases are occult, both the central and lateral neck can be observed safely. Some authors recommend elective central neck dissection for larger or more aggressive tumours; however, few support elective lateral neck dissection due to the high rates of morbidity. Although a rising thyroglobulin indicates disease recurrence, if a tumour de-differentiates, it will stop producing thyroglobulin, so an absence of a rise does not exclude recurrent disease."

Nearly 85% of these patients have an adenoma; 13% have hyperplasia of the glands; and a very small proportion have multiple adenomas or cancer. Familial hyperparathyroidism is genetically determined and associated with MEN-1 (primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenoma and pancreatic tumours such as insulinoma, gastrinoma and VIPoma) and MEN 2 (primary hyperparathyroidism, medullary carcinoma of thyroid and phaeochromocytoma). The familial variety can also exist as isolated hyperparathyroidism and as hyperplasia."

            "explanation": "1. B Hypoparathyroidism\nThis patient's early symptoms of tetany are from hypocalcaemia caused by hypoparathyroidism from inadvertent damage to the parathyroid glands. This may be due to injury, removal, or ischaemia during major neck surgery. The level of calcium at which symptoms of tetany develop can vary and is unpredictable. This is a medical emergency, particularly if the level is less than 1.9 mmol/IL An intravenous drip of 10% calcium gluconate might be necessary. This is supplemented by oral calcium and Vitamin D; magnesium supplements may also be required. If the hypocalcaemic symptoms are minimal with the serum level in the region of 2.0 mmol/L, oral calcium supplements of 1 g in divided doses is given. Less than 1% of patients undergoing such surgery will have such a complication permanently. The normal serum calcium is 2.2 to 2.6 mmol/L. Of the total calcium in the body, 50% is free ionised; of the rest 40% is bound to plasma proteins, whilst the remainder is bound with anions – citrate, phosphate and sulphate. When an abnormal serum calcium level is obtained from the laboratory, it is important to estimate the corrected serum calcium level, particularly in the presence of hypoalbuminaemia where the corrected serum calcium will be higher. The regulation of calcium homeostasis is the result of an interplay between parathormone (PTH) secreted by the parathyroids, the kidneys, the absorption of Vitamin D and calcitonin secreted by the parafollicular ‘C' cells of the thyroid. This is explained in Figure 51.1. When there is a drop in serum calcium, there is increased secretion of PTH acting in the form of a feedback mechanism as shown in Figure 51.2. PTH acts in concert with 1,25- dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25-DHCC, 1,25 vitamin D) and calcitonin on kidney and gut to maintain a constant blood-ionised calcium, which is necessary for nerve and muscle excitability and blood coagulation. PTH has a greater role in the regulation of serum calcium than calcitonin. The control of serum calcium by PTH is explained in Figure 51.3. The role of calcitonin is to cause a reduction in serum calcium and is explained in Figure 51.4. Serum calcium regulation is also linked to plasma phosphate (PO) levels. The normal PO level is 0.8 to 1.4 mmol/L; PTH increases the excretion of PO while increasing renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Variations in plasma PO levels affect serum calcium. In renal failure, there is increase in plasma PO that stimulates the parathyroids causing secondary hyperparathyroidism.\n2. C Primary hyperparathyroidism\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism, a condition resulting from an excessive secretion of PTH, is caused by a solitary parathyroid adenoma in 85% of patients; in 13%-14%, the cause might be multiglandular hyperplasia, whilst the remainder might be due to a carcinoma or multiple adenomas. The most common presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism from an adenoma is when it is discovered in an ʻasymptomatic' patient who undergoes a routine biochemical screening. When hypercalcaemia is found routinely and the cause is an adenoma and it is removed, patients admit to a huge sense of well being. In the past they had ascribed their insidious symptoms to ageing. Thus, strictly speaking, in retrospect the patient was not ‘asymptomatic' but had symptoms that could be pinpointed. Women are more often affected. It is said that 1% of the adult population is found to have hypercalcaemia on routine biochemical screening. The condition may be familial when it is a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome. When symptomatic, the clinical features reflect hypercalcaemia and hypophosphataemia: bone pain with x-ray changes in the hands (osteitis fibrosa cystica), skull (pepper-pot skull) and abdominal pain from peptic ulcer, recurrent pancreatitis and constipation. In almost one-third of patients there might be psychiatric symptoms. Renal disease in the form of nephrocalcinosis (Figure 51.5) and recurrent ureteric colic may be a presentation when a raised serum calcium alerts one to the diagnosis. These protean manifestations (Figure 51.6) have been traditionally summarised as 'stones, bones, psychic moans and abdominal groans', although such a florid presentation is rarely seen. Rarely, patients might present as a metabolic emergency due to acute hyperparathyroid hypercalcaemic crisis. The patient's corrected serum calcium should be carried out. For this the serum albumin is done (see previous section). The next step is to do the serum PTH. Elevated levels of PTH with hypercalcaemia and hypophosphataemia and increased excretion of calcium in the urine confirms a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. The next step is to localise the site of the adenoma. This is done by technetium-99 m labelled sestamibi scan and ultrasound to include the mediastinum to exclude an adenoma in an ectopic gland. In primary hyperparathyroidism, systematic bilateral neck exploration is done in cases of parathyroid hyperplasia where removal of three-and-a half glands is carried out with the remaining gland being marked with a metal clip or nonabsorbable suture or transplanted into the forearm. However, targeted parathyriodectomy through a small unilateral incision for an adenoma is the procedure of choice in the vast majority as solitary adenoma is the most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n3. D Secondary hyperparathyroidism\nThe main cause for secondary hyperparathyroidism is chronic renal failure (CRF), which is the cause in this patient. The other causes are chronic hypocalcaemia from vitamin D deficiency and malabsorption. The following can occur as a result of CRF: • Vitamin D is not converted into 1,25 Dihydroxycholecalciferol, which in turn inhibits absorption of calcium in the gut. • Reduced intestinal calcium absorption results in low-serum calcium and increased-serum PO due to failure of the kidney to excreste PO. • Hyperphosphtaemia and hypocalcaemia is present causing increased PTH secretion, thus producing secondary hyperparathyroidism. Such patients present with bone pain, muscle weakness and ectopic calcification in muscles of limbs or chest wall. This patient's serum calcium will be low or at the lower limit of normal. The management is medical initially with phosphate restriction and calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Hyperparathyroidism is usually due to multiple gland disease, which requires total parathyroidectomy. The causes of hypercalcaemia are shown in Figure 51.7.\n4. A Tertiary hyperparathyroidism\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs after long-standing secondary hyperparathyroidism, which in turn has resulted from prolonged chronic renal failure. Even after the renal failure has been successfully treated with a transplant, after a long period of parathyroid hyperplasia of all four glands, one of them becomes autonomous and turns into a dominant adenoma.The patient is investigated on the same lines as in primary hyperparathyroidism. These patients have hypercalcaemia and a dominant adenoma is found in the midst of hyperplastic glands. The treatment is total or subtotal parathyroidectomy, depending upon the scan findings. If subtotal parathyroidectomy is carried out, about 50 mg of one gland is autotransplanted into the forearm The summary of hyperparathyroidism is shown in Figure 51.8.\n5. E Tetany from gastric outlet obstruction.\nA long-standing healed duodenal ulcer produces cicatrisation with scarring and complete stenosis of the duodenum wrongly called ‘pyloric stenosis' – a misnomer because it is actually duodenal stenosis. A barium meal (Figure 51.9) would show smooth cut-off at pyloroduodenal junction where there is total obstruction with massive gastric dilatation with a large amount of food residue. Prolonged vomiting causes loss of H+, K+ and Cl¯ with increase in HCO3¯ resulting in hypcholraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. Fluid loss causes extreme dehydration seen clinically as sunken eyes, dry tongue and loss of skin turgor. The patient has carpo-pedal spasm because of tetany. Tetany is liable to occur in any form of alkalosis, in this case metabolic. This is because loss of H+ (normally bound to albumin) releases a place that is taken up by free ionised Ca++, which is now bound to albumin thus reducing ionised Ca++, resulting in tetany. The patient should be resuscitated by intravenous normal saline with added potassium chloride, indwelling catheter and CVP line; a large-bore stomach tube is inserted to wash out the stomach to empty semisolid stale food. Confirmation of the diagnosis is made by OGD. During OGD an attempt might be made to do balloon dilatation of the stenosis as a form of treatment that may only be temporary. The definitive surgical procedure is gastrojejunostomy – posterior, retro-colic, iso-peristaltic, short loop. Some surgeons might consider adding a truncal vagotomy to prevent a future anastomotic ulcer."
