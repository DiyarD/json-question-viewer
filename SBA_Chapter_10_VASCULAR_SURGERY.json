            "explanation": "Diabetic foot ulceration occurs in 15% of diabetics and is a common cause for major and minor amputations. Many ulcers are preventable if there is good communication between the patient, podiatrist and multidisci- plinary foot team. Patients are screened on a yearly basis and are risk assessed as high, medium or low. These patients need to be signposted to the appropriate foot care providers and educated that if ulceration does occur, then help should be sought within 24 hours. Optimisation of gly- caemic control, reducing pressure at ulcer sites by offloading devices, ensuring podiatry input and assessing the neurovascular status of the foot is essential. Common causes of ulceration are poor vascularity, incomplete sensation and abnormal bone structure or gait of the patient."

            "question": "As part of the peripheral vascular examination, you are asked to record the ankle-brachial pressure index of the patient. Which one of the following values reflects a normal ankle-brachial pressure index?",
            "options": [
                "A. Between 0.9 and 0.6",

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The ABPI is measured by dividing the highest systolic blood pressure measured in any ankle artery (either the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial artery) by the systolic pressure at the brachial artery. This test is performed using a Doppler and blood pressure cuff (sphygmoma- nometer). The cuff is inflated above the artery while the Doppler probe, connected to a pulse volume recorder, is placed just below or at the site of the artery. The cuff is gently deflated and the pressure, at which the first pulse sound is heard, is noted.\nAn ABPI greater than or equal to 1.0 is usually normal. ABPI values between 0.9 and 0.6 usually suggest peripheral vascular occlusive dis- ease such as intermittent claudication. This is progressive symptomatic arterial occlusion of the lower limbs due to atherosclerosis, resulting in pain on movement which is relieved by rest. Values between 0.6 and 0.3 usually suggest critical limb ischaemia and these patients usually have limb pain at rest. An ABPI less than or equal to 0.3 implies impending gangrene of the affected limb.\nPatients with diabetes or renal disease may have ABPI of greater than 1.3 which implies that the lower limb arterial walls may be calcified and are incompressible."

The pain is cramping in nature, well localized to the left calf only, and is relieved by rest. The patient has noticed that his walking distance has progressively decreased because of the cramps in the left calf. There are no abnormal findings on physical examination. What is the most appropriate way to investigate the patient's symptoms?",

                "E. None of the above"
            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The iliac and lower limb arteries are commonly affected in PVD. The main effect of PVD, of which the commonest cause is atherosclerosis, is to restrict blood flow to the limbs due to stenotic narrowing or occlusion of the arterial lumen. An increase in metabolic demand from muscles due to an increase in physical activity cannot be met due to the reduced blood flow and results in ischaemia. Patients are usually asymptomatic until a critical arterial stenosis is attained (75% of the cross-sectional area or 50% of the vessel diameter is reached).\nIntermittent claudication can be clinically described as cramp-like pain experienced in the muscles of the leg on walking, which is alleviated in minutes of resting. Cramp-like pain of intermittent claudication can be experienced in the calf, thigh or buttock muscles depending on the level at which the arterial occlusion is present.\nThe ABPI may be used as a first line diagnostic investigation for PVD in patients presenting with lower limb symptoms. This test is non- invasive, quick and cheap and is usually performed in an outpatient clinic setting. Duplex ultrasound scanning enables assessment of the distribution and extent of the disease and allows the risks and benefits of intervention to be discussed with the patient. A plain film radiograph of the lower limbs may not reveal any abnormalities. Angiography is not used as a first line investigation in the initial stages of forming a diagnosis of PVD. It is used for surgical planning in patients who are to undergo surgical or radiological interventional revascularization."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "A majority of patients who are initially diagnosed with vascular clau- dication will usually be counselled about their condition, and in most cases, no further treatment is required providing the claudication is not severe. Risk factors (e.g. hyperlipidaemia, smoking, poor exercise, and obesity) are usually identified and the patient is asked to correct these as part of managing their condition. Exercise and smoking ces- sation are factors which, if taken up by the patient, will most likely improve symptoms of claudication as well as decreasing overall car- diovascular risk.\nStructured exercise programmes are relatively cheap and safer than endovascular intervention (e.g. percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) and surgery, and have shown to be beneficial if followed for at least 6 months. Patients are asked to walk to near maximum pain tolerance as well as increasing their maximum walking distance; compliance is usually a confounding factor.\nWhere claudication is concerned, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and surgery are usually offered to patients after careful assessment of long-term efficacy of intervention, balanced by procedural risks and costs. These are patients who have severe claudication that has major implications on their social and working lifestyle (e.g. if the patient is unable to work or unable to look after themselves without help)."

            "question": "You see a 60-year-old man with a history of coronary heart disease, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia in your clinic. The patient has found it increasingly hard to walk due to the gradual increase in intensity of the cramping pain he experi-ences in his right leg on walking, which is relieved by resting a few minutes. In addition, he tells you that cramps have started to occur at night when he is sleeping. On examination of the right leg, you notice that there is a ‘punched out’ ulcer on the right heel. The right posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses are weak. You suspect that this patient has critical limb ischaemia. What is the most appropriate next line investigation that would support your diagnosis?",

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient is showing signs of critical limb ischaemia which is char- acterized by gradual worsening of claudication progressing to rest pain, ulceration and ultimately gangrene. Nocturnal limb pain, which occurs when the patient is asleep, results from a decrease in cardiac output, which in turn decreases systemic blood pressure, leading to a reduc- tion of perfusion pressure on the foot; hence ischaemic pain ensues. The ABPI would be the most appropriate next line investigation in this scenario. An ABPI between 0.6 and 0.3, coupled with a clinical history of rest pain, is highly suggestive of critical limb ischaemia.\nDoppler ultrasound, which was not an option in the question, is also another non-invasive investigation that can be performed to locate the stenosed area and confirm diagnosis. A plain film radiograph of the lower limbs would not be informative. Magnetic resonance imaging and CT angiography are possible investigations, but would not classically be the next line in this situation."

On examina-tion you notice a 3 cm x 4 cm leg ulcer in the gaiter area of the right leg, covering the medial malleolus. The shallow bed of the ulcer is covered with granulation tissue, which is surrounded by sloping edges. There is no history of trauma. From the list below, choose the most likely diagnosis.",

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Venous ulcers: These account for 80% of all skin ulcers, the majority being painless. They occur due to venous hypertension, which develops as a result of either increased hydrostatic pressure due to valve failure and weight of blood pressing distally, or due to the transmission of blood from the deep venous system to the superficial system (subcu- taneous veins and dermal capillaries) through incompetent valves. It is thought that white cells become trapped, leading to an increase in peripheral resistance and tissue ischaemia. Another school of thought postulates that tissue ischaemia develops due to the formation of fibrin plugs. Patients with venous ulcers usually have varicose veins, and 95% of venous ulcers occur in the gaiter area and characteristically around the medial malleoli. Venous ulcers may be discrete or circumferential, shallow, with irregular sloping edges and prominent granulation tissue in the bases. Prolonged ulceration with lipodermatosclerosis gives the leg a look of an inverted champagne bottle.\n• Arterial ulcers: These can be painful, have deep bases and bear a 'punched out' appearance. They are well demarcated and usually occur on the toes, heels and bony prominences of the foot. The base of the arterial ulcer may be pale, non-granulat- ing and necrotic. The surrounding skin may be cool to touch, hairless, thin, brittle, and erythematous and have a shiny texture. There are usually associated stigmata with peripheral arterial disease.\n• Neuropathic ulcers (cross-over with patients with peripheral arterial disease and diabetes): Patients with diabetes are more likely to get neuropathic ulcers. These occur at high pressure sites (i.e. the heel and metatarsal heads) and usually appear cleanly punched out of the surrounding callous. The patient may be suffering from neuropathic pain in the leg and the foot may be numb. Neuropathic ulcers are often painless and the patient may not have noticed them.\n• Traumatic ulcers: The patient will usually present with symmetrical damage, i.e. across the toes and margins of the feet due to wearing tight shoes. Other causes include burns, injections, sclerosants and cortisone.\n• Malignant ulcers: This can either be due to a primary or a secondary malignant lesion or may be caused by a malignant change in a pre-existing ulcer (e.g. Marjolin's ulcer). Some examples of malignant ulcers are epithelioma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and lymphoma."

The patient has the ‘6 Ps' (pain, pallor, pulselessness, paraesthe- sia, paralysis and perishingly cold) which indicate that the limb is unsalvageable.\n• Necrotizing fasciitis is an infection of the deep layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissues which spreads within the fascial plane of the subcutaneous tissue. Of the many organ- isms that cause this condition (group A streptococcus, Vibrio vulnificus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis), group A streptococcus is the most common. The infection usually starts at the site of local trauma and clinical features may include severe pain in the affected area and evidence of cellulitis, followed by swelling, erythema, vesicle and bul- lae formation on the skin surface; these may be absent if the bacteria are deep within the tissue. Patients are usually very ill with fever and, sometimes, diarrhoea and vomiting. Blood cultures and aspiration of pus at the site of the infected tis- sue can confirm the diagnosis. Prompt antibiotic therapy is required and the patient should be sent for emergency surgical debridement.\n• Spinal stenosis/claudication occurs as a result of nerve root compression (a history of recent trauma may be evident) at the level of the lumbosacral vertebra and usually affects patients in a dermatomal distribution. Weakness and paraesthesia of the limb supplied by the compressed nerve may be present. The pain is of rapid onset and made worse by movement and may be relieved when the patient sits down. Peripheral vascular examination is usually normal and diagnosis is made using MRI, although a plain film radiograph may show signs of vertebral disk space narrowing."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Emboli are the commonest cause of acute upper limb ischaemia. Occlusive disease leading to in situ thrombosis is rare in the upper limbs. Acute limb ischaemia is a surgical emergency and needs prompt surgical intervention. The classic clinical picture of severe pain, pal- lor, coldness with absent pulses, loss of sensation and paralysis points to acute limb ischaemia (the ‘6 Ps': pain, pallor, pulselessness, per- ishingly cold, paraesthesia and paralysis). The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which most likely points to the origin of the embolus.\nMovement and sensation of the left upper limb are preserved, indi- cating that the limb is salvageable. The fact that the left axillary pulse is present and distal pulses absent suggests that the level of the occlusion is in the brachial artery. Although collateral blood supply to the left arm will keep the limb viable, revascularization of the bra- chial artery will need to be initiated in order to alleviate symptoms and prevent claudication. Therefore, definitive management includes commencing a heparin infusion and sending the patient immediately to theatre for surgical exploration and embolectomy using a Fogarty catheter.\nThe anticoagulant effects of aspirin are not as effective as heparin. Aspirin therefore is not commonly used in the setting of interven- tion of acute limb ischaemia. Requesting an angiogram will delay the definitive management of this patient and should not take priority over surgical intervention. There is no history of trauma, making an under- lying fracture unlikely; and being a surgical emergency, managing the patient in A&E with analgesia is wrong."

It can occur in the aorta (most common), popliteal vessels (arterial and venous), circle of Willis, mesenteric arteries (rare) and splenic arteries (rare). The exact aetiology of aneurysms is unclear, although they are associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, connective tissue disorders and trauma. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are common in the elderly (over 60 years old) with men more commonly affected than women. A patient with an AAA usually presents with a pulsatile and expansile mass visible in the abdomen. Most AAAs are asymptomatic and discovered on either routine abdominal examination or by ultrasonography.\nUltrasound scanning is usually used to screen for, and monitor the growth of, AAAs. CT imaging is regarded as the investigation of choice in terms of diagnostic confirmation, defining aortic size, aneurismal position, that is, assessing the extension of the aneurysm into the suprarenal aorta. It has a sensitivity of nearly 100% where AAAs are concerned. Once an AAA is diagnosed, and is found to be less than 5.5 cm, the patient is routinely monitored. Ultrasound scanning (safe, non-invasive and usually requiring no patient preparation) is preferred for screening and monitoring patients with abdominal aortic aneu- rysms. Abdominal plain film radiography may show calcification of the abdominal aortic walls (this may suggest an AAA) but will be of no use in terms of screening and diagnosis. The role of angiography is uncer- tain in the assessment of patients with AAAs; it is invasive, and carries potential renal and embolic complications."

The risk of mortality secondary to surgical intervention is lower when compared with mortality resulting from a ruptured aneu- rysm of greater than 5.5 cm in diameter.\nAbdominal aortic aneurysms which are less than 5.5 cm are usually monitored with yearly ultrasound scanning. Abdominal aortic aneurysms up to 5 cm in size grow at an average rate of 1-4 mm per year, whereas those greater than 5.0 cm grow at a rate of 4-6 mm per year. Other indications for surgical repair year and the rate of the AAA of greater than 1 cm per year and the aneurysm becoming symptomatic (e.g. back pain, distal embolisation of one or both legs causing acute ischaemia) or tender. In addition, if a patient suddenly experiences an acute onset of back pain associated with hypotension, tachycardia and hypovolaemic shock, this indicates rupture of the AAA and emergency surgery is war- ranted, which has a mortality rate between 50% and 75%.\nElective surgical repair of an AAA can be performed either via the traditional laparotomy route, whereby a Dacron artificial graft is used to replace the aneurysmal aorta, or via the minimally invasive route known as endovascular aneurysm repair. EVAR is increasingly being practised for the elective repair of AAAs. EVAR involves accessing the femoral artery and, under radiological guidance, and endoluminal stent- graft is placed at the site of the aneurysm. Successful EVAR leads to a shorter hospital stay and decreased frequency of blood transfusions. In addition, EVAR can be performed in patients who are unfit for surgery, such as the elderly or those with other significant co-morbidities."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Patients with asymptomatic varicose veins can either be treated conser- vatively (i.e. patient education: avoiding long periods of standing; use of compression stockings; losing weight; frequent periods of walking – this helps to aid superficial to deep venous return in the legs) or by injec- tion sclerotherapy, which is particularly effective in below-the-knee varicosities. Sclerosants, such as ethanolamine and sodium tetradecyl, work by increasing the amount of intravascular granulation tissue, resulting in the occlusion of the vein lumen. Sclerosant is injected into the superficial varicosities at various sites, after which compres- sion bandaging is applied for a few weeks to prevent the formation of thrombi. Other techniques include the injection of sclerosant foam into the superficial venous system. The injection is placed in a superficial varicose vein (at one single site) and the distribution of foam is moni- tored using ultrasound. Sclerosant therapy may cause long-term hypo/ hyperpigmentation and ulceration at the injection site. If the sclerosant is passed into the femoral vein, anaphylaxis may ensue.\nIf quality of life is severely affected by varicose veins (i.e. severe impact on working and social lifestyle due to leg pain, venous ulceration, thrombophlebitis) surgery can be offered. Surgery is the most effec- tive treatment for large varicose veins, and aims to correct the deep to superficial reflux and to remove varicosities. Various forms of surgery for varicose veins are now available, for example:\n• Ligation of either the saphenofemoral (tributaries of long saphenous vein are also ligated) or saphenopopliteal (ligation of short saphenous vein deep in the popliteal fossa) junctions\n• Multiple avulsions of the varicosities and endoluminal radiofrequency ablation of the long saphenous vein followed by multiple avulsions of superficial varicosities\n• Multiple avulsions of the varicosities and laser ablation of the long saphenous vein followed by multiple avulsions of superfi- cial varicosities\nPostoperatively, compression stockings are worn for several weeks and exercise is encouraged. Patients are able to resume normal daily activi- ties considerably quicker compared with the conventional methods of varicose vein surgery. In this question the patient's quality of life is being affected by the varicose veins in her left lower limb. Surgery is therefore the most appropriate treatment modality, although recurrence rates are approximately 50%."

It should be used with caution in patients with renal dysfunction.\nWarfarin has a prothrombotic effect within the first 48 hours of adminis- tration and usually takes up to 72 hours to exert its antithrombotic effect. It is usually given along with LMWH (where high-risk DVT patients are concerned) and is monitored using the INR (the ratio of a patient's pro- thrombin time to a normal control sample). When the INR reaches 2–3, LMWH can be stopped and warfarin can be continued for 3-6 months postoperatively, depending on the patient's clotting risk. Aspirin and clop- idogrel are not as effective as LMWH and warfarin at preventing venous thrombus. They are preferred in anti-arterial thrombus prophylaxis."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "described by Virchow (also known as Virchow's triad). The legs are common sites for the development of DVT.\nThere are two main types of DVT: below knee and above knee. Below knee DVTs occur most frequently in the calf veins, with those in the soleal plexus being commonly affected. Above knee DVTs are consid- ered relatively more dangerous than below knee DVTs as there is a higher risk of developing pulmonary emboli.\nThere are numerous risk factors for developing DVTs. The major risk factors include age over 40; pregnancy; obesity; contraceptive pill; clotting abnormalities; malignancy; recent pelvic or orthopaedic surgery; trauma; immobility; long-haul flights; and failure to provide DVT prophylaxis for high-risk patients postoperatively. The majority of patients who have DVT are asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, pain is the commonest followed by swelling of the affected limb. In some cases, distension of the superficial veins with erythema may be present.\nD-dimers are small protein fragments of fibrin (fibrin degradation prod- uct) which are formed when a thrombus is degraded by fibrinolysis. D-dimer blood tests are sensitive but not specific for DVT.\nThe pretest clinical probability (Wells) score (based on a series of ques- tions) is used to assess the probability of a patient having a DVT.\nA score above or equal to 2 is regarded as a ‘likely DVT’ and the patient is treated as suspected DVT. A proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be carried out within 4 hours of being requested and if the result is neg- ative, a D-dimer test should be carried out. If a proximal leg vein ultra- sound scan cannot be obtained within 4 hours, a D-dimer test should be carried out and an interim 24-hour dose of parenteral anticoagulant should be given; however, the proximal leg vein ultrasound should be performed within 24 hours of being requested. A repeat proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be performed 6–8 days later for all patients with a positive D-dimer test (and Wells score of 2 or above) and a nega- tive proximal leg vein ultrasound scan.\nA score less than or equal to 1 is regarded as an ‘unlikely DVT’and with this a D-dimer test is performed. If this is positive, the patient should undergo a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan within 4 hours of being requested. If a proximal leg vein ultrasound cannot be performed within 4 hours, the patient is commenced on an interim 24-hour dose of parenteral anticoagulant whilst waiting for an ultrasound scan which should be performed within 24 hours of being requested.\nA DVT can be excluded if the D-dimer result is negative."

This test is used as part of the vascular examination of varicose veins. Varicose are long, tortuous and dilated veins of the superficial venous system and can either be primary, due to congenital abnormal- ity or even absence of valves in the perforator system, or secondary, due to thrombosis of deep or superficial veins, pregnancy, abdominal and pelvic masses and obesity. Although this test is not commonly per- formed, it is worth knowing the principles for the purposes of exams.\nThe patient is asked to lie down on the examination couch and the affected leg is elevated and the varicosities are milked and emptied. After sufficient drainage of the veins, with the patient's leg still ele- vated, a tourniquet is placed as high on the thigh as possible. The patient is then asked to stand up and the rate of filling of the varicosities is assessed. If the varicosities do not fill, it implies that the defect lies above the tourniquet. On the other hand, if the veins refill rapidly, this means that the defect lies below the tourniquet. This has largely been replaced by a venous duplex which is now the gold standard."

The description usually given by patients is of a ‘black curtain descend- ing vertically and obscuring vision in one eye'. It usually occurs as a result of atherogenic emboli arising from the carotid artery territory (therefore, option B is the most likely from the list), which unilater- ally obstruct the lumen of the retinal arterial circulation. This leads to decreased blood flow to the retina, resulting in ischaemia.\nOther less common causes of amaurosis fugax are cardiac emboli and temporary vasospasm of the retinal artery (usually occurs in young people during exercise) and atherosclerosis of the ophthalmic artery. Giant cell arteritis causes chronic granulomatous inflammation of the central retinal artery, which can occlude and produce symptoms similar to that of amaurosis fugax."

If this patient group is given optimal medical ther- apy (i.e. lipid-lowering medication and anti-hypertensives coupled with stopping smoking and an increase in physical activity) after the carotid endarterectomy, this reduces the risk of stroke by 6- to 10-fold. On the other hand, if patients who fall into this category are treated medi- cally, rather than surgically, they have a significant increased chance of developing a stroke.\nPatients with a symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50%–70% are usually given optimal medical therapy first. If symptoms continue, carotid endarterectomy is warranted within 48 hours. Patients with symp- tomatic carotid stenosis of less than 50% are usually given optimal medical therapy, and if symptoms persist they are usually referred for investigations.\nAsymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis greater than 80% are can- didates for carotid endarterectomy, although this is a controversial topic."

Blood then passes into the media and extends either proximally or dis- tally leading to the formation of a double lumen (occluding important branches of the aorta: coronary, carotid or renal arteries) or rupture into the pericardium (leading to cardiac tamponade) or mediastinum (resulting in a fatal haemorrhage) or affecting the attachments of the aortic valve (leading to aortic incompetence). The most common site for an aortic dissection is in the arch of the aorta.\nSeventy per cent of aortic dissections affect the ascending aorta (type A) while 30% affect the descending aorta (type B). Congenital causes include associations with Marfan's disease and Ehlers-Danlos syn- drome. Acquired causes include hypertension and atherosclerosis. Patients usually present with sudden onset of severe tearing chest pain that radiates to the back between the scapulae. The pain may radiate to the neck, shoulder or abdomen. Associated symptoms include short- ness of breath, dizziness, hemiplegia (carotid involvement) and hae- maturia (renal involvement). The patient may be pale, sweaty (signs of shock) and there may be differing blood pressure measurements in each arm with the disappearance and reappearance of distal pulses. Fundamental aspects of management include fluid resuscitation while maintaining systolic blood pressure below 100 mmHg (to prevent excessive blood loss), cross-matching 10 units of blood, blood tests (full blood count, urea and electrolytes and coagulation screen) and call for senior help. Usually type A dissections are treated surgically due to high risk of tamponade. Type B dissections tend to be managed conservatively, but secondary symptoms may necessitate an endovas- cular approach."

Raynaud's syn- drome can be unilateral whereas Raynaud's disease is systemic and occurs bilaterally.\nRaynaud's disease is diagnosed by exclusion of the other causes which may be due to Raynaud's syndrome. Blood tests (such as full blood count, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, cryoglobulins, anti- nuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor), cold provocation tests and upper limb and digital pressures can be performed to search for an underlying cause.
