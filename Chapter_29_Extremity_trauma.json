            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Up to 30% to 40% of fractures of the scaphoid are not identified on initial four-view radiographs (Figure 29.4), with the clinical scaphoid fracture continuing to be a diagnostic conundrum. Posterior dislocations of the shoulder are classically (although not exclusively) associated with a seizure or electrocution, with displacement of the head in a posterior-inferior direction. Posterior dislocations (5%) are much rarer than an anterior dislocation (95%) and are easily missed on initial radiographs, with the anteroposterior (AP) view appearing normal apart from a possible lightbulb sign. A lateral or axillary view will clarify the diagnosis. Lateral condyle fractures of the elbow in children can be missed on initial radiographs, with an internal oblique view helpful. Hip fractures are identified routinely on initial radiographs of the pelvis and hip, although in cases where the diagnosis is unclear, further imaging in the form of CT or MRI can be indicated. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis in children is analogous to a posterior dislocation of the shoulder and may often appear normal on an AP pelvis view, with a frog-leg lateral view best for identifying the true extent of the slip. Distal radius fractures are routinely identified on standard AP and lateral views of the wrist."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "CT is the optimal imaging modality to determine the extent of any spinal fracture, e.g., number of columns involved, particularly in the polytrauma patient. The secondary survey in the ATLS protocol is part of a look-everywhere approach, and a CT head to pelvis is now used routinely in many centres. CT is also useful in planning surgery for complex peri-articular fractures, although availability and radiation dose should be considered. Ultrasound is useful for diagnosing soft tissue injuries, e.g., rotator cuff tears around the shoulder, but is operator dependent. MRI is primarily useful for assessing soft tissue injuries and some fractures. For certain spinal fractures, it may be used to assess the extent of ligamentous and/or cord injury but would not routinely be the next line of investigation. MRI is expensive and specialist equipment is needed in the ventilated patient. Bone scan is useful for assessing pathological fractures and possible metastases. Fluoroscopy is used intra-operatively."

            "explanation": "Any open fracture associated with an arterial injury requiring repair is a type IIIC. The Gustillo and Anderson classification (Table 29.1) is designed for open fractures and applies to the state of the soft tissue. The classification does not take account of the body part involved. The primary concern is the energy imparted to the soft tissue and hence its disruption, as well as the soft-tissue cover of the fracture and whether there is contamination. These factors are important to determine treatment and predict outcome. Some injuries are classified as a grade III irrespective of wound size or soft tissue injury, e.g., traumatic amputation, segmental fracture, or heavy contamination (e.g., farming, gunshot)."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Radiological union is routinely characterised by the bridging of 3 of 4 cortices at the fracture site. Malunion is characterised by bone healing in a non-anatomical position. Generally, this is considered as an articular step of > 2mm, with angulation or rotation < 5 degrees. Delayed union is used to describe a fracture that has not healed within the expected time. Diagnosing a delayed union is fracture dependent, e.g., femoral fractures in adult can take 12–16 weeks to unite. Fractures in children unite quicker than fractures in adults, and upper-limb fractures unite quicker than lower-limb fractures. Non-union is defined as failure to develop signs of clinical and radiological healing. Following are the three types of non-union: 1 Atrophic – No callus formation, thinning of the fractures ends, associated with poor blood supply, fracture mobile. 2 Hypertrophic – Abundant callus formation, expansion of bone ends, no bridging of the fracture site, associated with poor stability or fixation. 3 Infected - Union prevented by infection, potentially catastrophic complication, multi-stage treatment may be required. 4 Risk factors for delayed or non-union include patient (age, diabetes, smoking, NSAIDs), fracture (open, severe soft tissue damage, infection, neurovascular injury) and management (inadequate fracture reduction or fixation) characteristics."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "There are two stages in treating a fracture. The first of these is reduction, or putting the fragments back together so that the shape and alignment of the bone are correct. This is not always necessary and is dependent on both patient and fracture characteristics. If the fracture is undisplaced or the displacement does not matter, reduction is not needed. The second stage is 'stabilisation'. Not all fractures need stabilization – they might be stable once reduced, while others cannot easily be reduced or stabilised, nevertheless, they will heal. Benefits of fracture treatment include pain relief, restoration of anatomy and preservation of function, early mobilisation of the joint and the patient, prevention of infection and, potentially, reduced risk of secondary OA. Risks of fracture management include anaesthesia, possible introduction of infection, perisosteal stripping, soft tissue or neurovascular damage and the need for a second operation to remove metalwork. Relative stability refers to a degree of movement at the fracture site that is expected and leads to indirect or secondary bone union with callus formation (enchondral ossification). Absolute stability occurs when the fracture has be anatomically reduced and stabilised so that there is no motion at the fracture site. The result is primary bone healing without callus formation, e.g., bone remodelling with cutting cones crossing the fracture site and lamellar bone being laid down."

            "explanation": "Assessment and management of open fractures should start with ATLS guidelines. The first step is to lavage and photograph the wound, followed by using an iodine-soaked gauze to cover the fracture. Reduction of fracture may be necessary ary if there is surrounding skin or neurovascular compromise. The fracture should be immobilised for comfort and to prevent further soft tissue damage. Intravenous antibiotics should be commenced and the patient's tetanus status ascertained. The timing to theatre remains controversial, particularly for lower-grade fractures. Debridement involves wound extension and removal of all contaminated or devitalised soft tissue, followed by delivery and cleaning of the bone ends via the wound. Fracture stabilisation is then carried out. In this case primary fixation, possibly with a volar pate, would be carried out. However, temporary, e.g., external fixation may be carried out if there is concern about the soft tissue, contamination, or patient stability. For small (Grade 1) open wounds associated with a fracture, a thorough exploration, debridement and closing the wound primarily at the time of surgery would be done by many. All other open wounds would return to theatre at 48 hours for review +/- closure."

For extracapsular intertrochanteric or pertrochanteric fractures, there is no problem with the blood supply but strong fixation is required to allow early mobilisation. The dynamic hip screw is effectively a combination of an intramedullary nail fitted up the femoral neck, which connects to a heavy plate screwed to the side of the femur. The nail in the neck can slide into a slot in the nail so, that the fracture ends can be compressed together. This improves stability and stimulates bone healing."
