            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- A parapneumonic effusion is a pleural effusion arising in association with an infectious lung focus (e.g., pneumonia, lung abscess, infected bronchiectasis).\n- The Health and Science Policy Committee of the American College of Chest Physicians developed a 4-tier categorization of parapneumonic effusions based on the pleural space anatomy, the bacteriology of the fluid, and the fluid chemistry.\n- Category 1 parapneumonic effusions are minimal, free-flowing effusions (<10 mm on lateral decubitus film) with very low risk of a poor outcome. Treatment includes antibiotics and observation.\n- Category 2 parapneumonic effusions are small to moderate, free-flowing effusions (>10 mm on lateral decubitus film but less than half the hemithorax) with negative Gram stain/culture of the pleural fluid and a pH greater than 7.20. They have a low risk of poor outcome and require antibiotics and pleural fluid sampling with thoracentesis.\n- Category 3 parapneumonic effusions are large, free-flowing effusions involving half or more of the hemithorax on lateral decubitus film, loculated effusions, effusions with thickened parietal pleura, effusions with positive bacterial Gram stain/culture, or effusions with a pH less than 7.20. They have a moderate risk for poor outcome and require antibiotic therapy and drainage via tube thoracostomy.\n- Category 4 parapneumonic effusions have pus within them and a high risk of poor outcome.\n- For this patient, a free-flowing effusion confined to 25% of the hemithorax describes a category 2 parapneumonic effusion, which would be amenable to drainage with a small-bore tube."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- Elevation of the hemidiaphragm may occur in a variety of settings; it is important to determine whether it is due to other anatomic factors or to unilateral paralysis.\n- Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis may be tumor related, viral infection, surgery, trauma, or idiopathic.\n- The finding of an elevated hemidiaphragm on a chest X-ray or CT scan is nonspecific and does not confirm unilateral hemidiaphragm paralysis.\n- Fluoroscopy is often cited as a method to confirm the diagnosis, recording diaphragmatic motion while the patient sniffs.\n- Ultrasonography is also described as a novel method to detect paralysis.\n- Both fluoroscopy and ultrasonography are highly dependent on patient effort and subject to operator error.\n- The most reliable test to quantify the mechanical function of the diaphragm is the measurement of negative pressure generated by contraction in response to phrenic nerve stimulation.\n- Phrenic nerve stimulation is the best means to distinguish between neuropathic and myopathic conditions causing unilateral paralysis."

            "explanation": "- The clinical history and CT scan findings are consistent with spontaneous pneumomediastinum.\n- This condition is thought to be caused by alveolar rupture with tracking along the bronchovascular bundle to the mediastinum.\n- Most patients present with chest pain, shortness of breath, and sometimes neck pain; asthma is a common predisposing comorbidity.\n- Careful review of history for trauma, aerodigestive instrumentation, or vomiting is important, as esophageal rupture would be a diagnostic consideration.\n- White blood cell count may be mildly elevated, but fever is not common and would raise suspicion for visceral rupture.\n- Diagnosis is suggested by physical exam and chest x-ray showing pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous air in the neck, with subsequent chest CT scan as the standard of care.\n- Diffuse pneumomediastinum is seen without pleural effusions; effusions or mediastinal fluid collections raise concern for visceral rupture.\n- Given this patient's presenting history and clinical condition, observation without further testing is reasonable.\n- Most patients need pain control with intravenous pain medication initially.\n- Esophagram would be indicated with a history of emesis or in the presence of fever, pleural effusions, or trauma/instrumentation.\n- Bronchoscopy, antibiotics, and drain placement are not needed; air typically resorbs within 1 to 3 days."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- This case describes a common scenario in managing malignant pleural effusions.\n- Pleural fluid cytology is not very sensitive, and clinical suspicion should prompt further evaluation for malignancy; atypical cells do not rule out malignancy, and malignant effusions often have negative cytology on first evaluation.\n- Nonexpansile lung after thoracentesis that persists despite chest tube placement in the absence of air leak defines \"trapped lung,\" caused by tumor implants and chronic compression with scar tissue.\n- Pneumothorax ex vacuo occurs in approximately half of all malignant pleural effusions.\n- A trapped lung is a contraindication to pleurodesis as visceral and parietal surfaces are not in contact.\n- Indwelling pleural catheters are the only option for palliation in trapped lung circumstances.\n- A second chest tube will not improve the situation and is unnecessary.\n- Thoracotomy and decortication are overly aggressive for an 85-year-old man with advanced malignancy.\n- Obtaining tissue is critical for targeted therapy and immunotherapy; single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a reasonable option for pleural biopsies.\n- The patient's symptoms improved with thoracentesis, which is common even with trapped lung.\n- Placing an indwelling pleural catheter for home drainage effectively palliates dyspnea and improves quality of life, reducing hospital time."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Pneumomediastinum can be spontaneous or related to trauma, instrumentation, severe coughing/vomiting, forced straining, or asthma.\n- It is most often identified on CT imaging.\n- In spontaneous pneumomediastinum, associated injury to the esophagus, trachea, or mediastinal structures is uncommon, and extensive workup is not required.\n- Workup should be considered for patients with recent instrumentation, penetrating trauma, violent retching, or associated pleural effusion, as the chance for mediastinal organ injury is higher.\n- Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not indicated unless specific mediastinal contamination is present.\n- Asymptomatic blunt trauma patients can be safely observed because mediastinal injury occurs in less than 2%."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Based on the history of retching and imaging showing mediastinal air and gross soilage of the pleura and mediastinum, this patient likely has spontaneous distal esophageal perforation (Boerhaave syndrome).\n- The patient's condition has progressed to sepsis, likely due to mediastinitis.\n- Therapeutic intervention is urgent and begins with fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics.\n- In patients with Boerhaave syndrome presenting with gross mediastinal and pleural contamination, surgical intervention is the mainstay of therapy.\n- Thoracotomy with primary esophageal repair is the standard of care in Boerhaave syndrome, commonly via left thoracotomy with possible phreno-laparotomy to expose the tear site.\n- Copious irrigation of the mediastinum and pleural space plus debridement of devitalized tissue is important.\n- Primary full-thickness esophageal repair is performed if possible, with reinforcement by a fundic wrap or pleural flap.\n- The mediastinum and pleura are widely drained with large bore chest tubes.\n- Esophagectomy with cervical esophagostomy is recommended only for patients with widespread esophageal necrosis where repair is impossible, typically presenting >24 hours after the inciting event.\n- Nonoperative management should only be considered for patients with small ruptures contained in the mediastinum, draining back into the esophagus, absence of pleural contamination, and no evidence of sepsis.\n- If nonoperative management is attempted, nothing by mouth, antibiotics, and chest tube drainage are necessary.\n- Some patients may benefit from covered esophageal stent placement, and some centers prefer stent placement as first-line treatment.\n- Endoscopic clips may be used for mucosal defects in acute esophageal perforation, but only in early course and experienced centers."

            "explanation": "- The processus vaginalis is an abdominal wall opening allowing testicular descent in utero.\n- In girls, ovaries remain intra-abdominal, and the round ligament lies in the inguinal canal.\n- In both sexes, the processus vaginalis involutes between 25-35 weeks gestational age, with the left side obliterating first.\n- Persistent communication can lead to hydrocele (fluid in scrotum) or inguinal hernia (bowel passes through).\n- The incidence of a patent processus vaginalis is greatest at birth and gradually declines with age.\n- Inguinal hernias can incarcerate in infants, requiring timely repair; incarceration rates are 4.6-28%.\n- Special circumstances like preterm infants need careful evaluation due to higher postoperative apnea or mechanical ventilation risk (up to 9%).\n- Randomized controlled trials show greater success with laparoscopic repair compared to open, with fewer recurrent herniations (0.2% vs. 1.0%).\n- Laparoscopy allows bilateral repair without additional incisions.\n- Controversy exists regarding contralateral inguinal region exploration in unilateral hernia.\n- Risk of bilateral herniorrhaphy to vas deferens during dissection exists.\n- Many surgeons argue for bilateral repair if the left side has a hernia, as the left processus vaginalis normally closes first.\n- Recent series found no decreased incidence of occult contralateral patent processus vaginalis or inguinal hernia based on side of presentation.\n- Most authors advocate discussing with parents the risk of future contralateral inguinal hernia (2.4% over 2 years) and deferring to parental judgment.\n- Sex further confounds the issue; meta-analysis found no significant difference in contralateral hernia incidence between female and male children."
