            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "There are four stages of anaesthesia (classified by Arthur Ernest Guedel):\nStage 1 refers to induction of anaesthesia whereby patients begin to slowly lose consciousness.\nStage 2 is called the excitement stage where there is complete loss of consciousness, but there may be uncontrolled movement.\nStage 3 is call the surgical anaesthesia phase whereby the skeletal muscles begin to relax and eye movement stops. The patient is now ready for surgery.\nStage 4 is the overdose phase, whereby the patient has received too much medication resulting in severe brain stem or medullary depression leading to subsequent hypotension or circulatory failure. Stage 4 can be fatal and requires prompt clinical support and close monitoring."

            "question": "A 57-year-old lady is post total thyroidectomy for thyromegaly with retrosternal extension. During the transfer of the patient from theatre to recovery, she develops shortness of breath. The patient is alert and speaking in complete sentences. Her respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute, pulse is 90 beats per minute and blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg. Oxygen saturations have decreased from 98% on 2 litres of oxygen per minute to 92%. On examination of the chest, there is decreased expansion of the right hemithorax and ipsilateral reduced air entry and hyper-resonance.

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "From the clinical history and examination, this patient is having an acute onset of shortness of breath secondary to a right pneumothorax. This is not a tension pneumothorax because there are no signs of haemodynamic compromise. Furthermore, the airway is patent because the patient is able to speak in complete sentences and therefore an upper airway obstruction secondary to a surgical wound haematoma is unlikely here.\nThe immediate management of an acutely ill surgical patient should follow a sequence of\n• Airway (A) assessment and treatment\n• Breathing (B) assessment and treatment\n• Circulation (C) assessment and treatment\n• Dysfunction (D) of the CNS; neurological status can be assessed rapidly by examining the pupils as well as using the ‘AVPU’ system (A - alert, V – responds to verbal stimulus, P – responds to pain and U – unresponsive to any stimulus)\n• Exposure (E) of the patient sufficient for full assessment and treatment\nAlthough the definitive treatment for this patient is to insert a chest drain, using the ‘ABCDE’system, the patient has decreased oxygen saturations despite receiving 2 litres of oxygen per minute. She therefore requires high flow oxygen in aid of increasing oxygen saturations. Nasal cannula are used to deliver oxygen at low flow rates of up to 5 litres per minute. In the initial stages of her management this patient requires high flow oxygen delivery and this will be achieved using 10–15 litres of oxygen per minute using a non-rebreathe facemask."

The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia and lasted one and a half hours. You are asked to see the patient due to the fact that he has become acutely confused and drowsy.

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The clinical history, combined with the nature of the surgical procedure and the onset of symptoms, point towards TURP syndrome, which occurs following absorption of excess irrigation fluid (mostly glycine). This condition is characterised by an increase in intravascular volume, dilutional hyponatraemia, intracellular oedema and metabolism of glycine to ammonia. Clinical signs include bradycardia or arrhythmias, hypertension followed by hypotension, dyspnoea, visual disturbance, and mental irritation leading to reduced levels of consciousness.\nIn summary, following initial resuscitation protocol, the management of TURP syndrome involves slow correction of the hyponatraemia with diuretics; the use of hypertonic saline is controversial. In addition, close patient monitoring (for coagulopathy, electrolyte disturbances, hypothermia and arrhythmias) is required and therefore, the intensive care and surgical teams should be involved as soon as possible.\nSepsis is possible, but unlikely given the history. The patient is not hyperthermic owing to a normal body temperature and it is unlikely for the patient to have a microcytic anaemia causing his acute deterioration."

                "E. Request an urgent mobile chest radiograph"
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Hypovolaemia is not uncommon in elderly patients who have had major surgical procedures. The elevated pulse rate coupled with a reduced blood pressure and low urine output suggests that the patient is hypovolaemic. Following the ‘ABCDE' system (please refer to Question 3 in this chapter for further information), increasing this patient's supplemental oxygen flow rate is not an unreasonable step to take; however, the patient is maintaining adequate oxygen saturations on 3 litres of oxygen per minute. This question points towards a 'C' (circulation) problem which requires treatment and re-evaluation.\nCalling the Surgical Registrar, performing an arterial blood gas and requesting an urgent mobile chest radiograph are steps which may need to be taken in the future, but initially this patient requires an intravenous fluid challenge to ascertain whether the urine output increases. In most cases this type of problem can be corrected with adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation but care must be taken in patients who have cardiac and pulmonary co-morbidities. The use of fluid balance charts is imperative in patients who have undergone major surgery."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This patient is suffering from an acute pulmonary embolism owing to the acute onset of shortness of breath, low oxygen saturations and normal chest examination. The electrocardiogram shows a sinus tachycardia, which is more frequently seen in pulmonary embolism than the traditionally taught prominent S wave in lead 1, Q wave and an inverted T wave in lead 3 (‘S1Q3T3').\nThe patient is tachypnoeic which will result in a decreased blood concentration of carbon dioxide leading to hypocapnia. The decreased levels of carbon dioxide will lead to a decreased concentration of hydrogen ions resulting in an alkalosis. In addition, the level of bicarbonate is usually normal in the acute phase. Respiratory alkalosis is therefore the acid-base disturbance which would occur in this scenario."

This results in widespread intravascular occlusion in small and large vessels. Vascular occlusion by fibrin causes shock and end organ failure whilst high consumption of clotting factors and platelets increases the bleeding tendency.\nFrom this list of answers platelets (Answer B) would be the most appropriate blood product to request.

Cardiac tamponade can also occur during cardiac catheterisation, central line insertion or insertion of a pacemaker. Some non-traumatic causes include hypothyroidism, pericarditis, invasive neoplastic disease and high exposure of the chest to radiation.\nOn assessment of the patient with cardiac tamponade the following signs may be seen (the first three of which are referred to as Beck's triad):\n• Hypotension (due to obstructive shock)\n• Increased jugular venous pressure\n• Muffled heart sounds\n• Kussmaul's sign; a paradoxical rise in JVP on inspiration\n• Electromechanical dissociation arrest"

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "ARDS is characterised by reducing lung compliance and hypoxaemia due to a combination of acute respiratory failure (due to acute lung injury) with the formation of non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. The condition is refractory to oxygen therapy and can be diagnosed if the following three are present:\n• Chest radiographs or CT imaging confirms bilateral pulmonary infiltrates\n• Acute onset; within 1 week of a known clinical insult\n• Refractory hypoxaemia: PaO2:FIO2 <200\nThe pulmonary artery capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) being ≤18 mmHg was part of the diagnostic criteria but has now been removed."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The most common surgical cause of hypocalcaemia is inadvertent removal or damage to the parathyroid glands during thyroid surgery. Clinical features associated with hypocalcaemia include (1)neuromuscular irritability which may manifest as peripheral and circumoral parathesia, (2) tetany, (3) muscular cramps, (4) twitching of the facial muscles on tapping of the facial nerve (Chvostek's sign) and (5) tetanic spasm of the hand following blood pressure cuff-induced arm ischaemia (Trousseau's sign). This patient is experiencing symptomatic hypocalcaemia and requires close monitoring and correction of the low serum calcium. Following initial assessment using the ‘ABCDE’ system (refer to Question 3 in this chapter), the most appropriate next step to take is to establish cardiac monitoring to monitor for cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, an ECG trace may show intermittent QT prolongation.\nPrescribing bisphosphonates or calcitonin or administering high dose steroids are measures which are usually taken in the management of hypercalcaemia.\nThe patient does not need to be taken back to theatre and hence contacting the Surgical Registrar would not be indicated."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Vitamins A, D, E and K are fat soluble. Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin which is important for the stabilisation of cell membranes as well as retinal function. Vitamin D is required for calcium homeostasis and mineralisation of bone. Vitamin K is required for blood coagulation through the γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues of the clotting factors, namely II, VII, IX and X.\nThe family of Vitamin B (B1/B2/B3/Biotin/B6/B12) and Vitamin C are water soluble vitamins. Vitamin C, as well as possessing antioxidant functions, plays an important role in hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis, absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal system and the synthesis of epinephrine from tyrosine. Vitamin B1 (riboflavin) deficiency leads to Weinicke's encephalopathy or beri-beri."

Two blood culture bottles (anaerobic and aerobic blood culture bottles) should always be taken and sent to the pathology laboratory promptly. The blood culture analysis usually takes a minimum of 3 days, however in some cases, owing to high amounts of bacteraemia and higher bacterial proliferation rates, results may be relayed to you in 2 days. Antibiotic therapy should start after a blood culture investigation is performed. An in-dwelling central venous catheter could be the source of sepsis and blood cultures should be taken through them to isolate the offending organism.\nGenerally the following measures should be taken within the first 6 hours from onset of symptoms in patients with suspected sepsis:\n• Administer high flow oxygen\n• Take blood cultures\n• Administer intravenous antibiotics\n• Commence intravenous fluid resuscitation\n• Measure and check haemoglobin and lactate levels\n• Accurate measurement of hourly urine output and fluid balance\nFor further information, please refer to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign at www.survivingsepsis.org."

            "explanation": "The patient is experiencing anaphylaxis from the blue dye. This is a rare complication and occurs at an incidence rate of 0.1%, but can be fatal if not managed promptly. Patients who develop intraoperative anaphylaxis may show signs of tachycardia, hypotension, laryngeal oedema and bronchospasm. The mainstay of treatment involves maintaining intravascular volume through intravenous fluid resuscitation to anticipate the ensuing hypotension. Administering intravenous adrenaline is also required to maintain systemic vascular resistance. Once the patient is stable, intravenous antihistamine (e.g. chlorpheniramine) and hydrocortisone are administered. From the list of answers, maintaining intravascular volume with intravenous fluids would be the most appropriate step in the first instance followed by administering intravenous adrenaline to maintain systemic vascular resistance. Removal of the endotracheal tube and waking the patient would be fatal due to the fact that the endotracheal tube is maintaining the airway and its removal would lead to loss of the airway secondary to anaphylaxis inducing laryngeal oedema. Intravenous antihistamines and steroids are used once the patient is resuscitated and stable. Since the procedure being performed is an elective case, continuing with the operation is not indicated. Anaphylaxis is a life threatening condition and needs to be attended to first."
