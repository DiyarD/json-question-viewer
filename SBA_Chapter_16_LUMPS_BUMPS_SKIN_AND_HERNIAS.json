            "explanation": "Lymph nodes are the most common neck swellings in clinical practice, accounting for some 85% of all such presentations. Cervical lymphadenopathy itself can be local or occur as part of a generalized, systemic lymphadenopathy.\nInfectious mononucleosis (Pfeiffer's disease/glandular fever) is a viral illness resulting from EBV infection. It commonly occurs in young adults and teenagers, presenting with fever, sore throat, lethargy and myalgia. A blood film typically shows a reactive lymphocytosis of between 35% and 70% of the total leucocyte count and atypical T cells known as Downey bodies. Infectious mononucleosis is usually definitively diagnosed by a positive Monospot/Paul Bunnell test. Treatment involves simple analgesics and bed rest."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The description is that of a thyroglossal cyst. These are persistent remnants of the thyroglossal duct, which guides the passage of the thyroid gland during development. Typically, these cysts are smooth, round and 2-3 cm in diameter. They occur more commonly in females, especially teenagers and young adults. On examination the lump tends to move up with swallowing and tongue protrusion. Definitive management is by excision of the lump. Lingual thyroid occurs when residual tissue is left on the base of the tongue as the thyroid migrates along its tract during development."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that occurs most commonly in women (10:1) between the ages of 20 and 50 years. It is associated with signs of hyperthyroidism including the following:\n• Weight loss\n• Heat intolerance\n• Sweating\n• Diarrhoea\n• Tremor\n• Irritability\n• Increased activity\n• Emotional lability\n• Psychosis\n• Exophthalmos\n• Tremor\n• Ophthalmoplegia\n• Diffuse thyroid enlargement\nMost commonly there is an increase in antibodies against TSH receptors, resulting in a reduced level of TSH and increased free T4 and T3. It is also associated with other autoimmune disorders such as pernicious anaemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus and Addison's disease. Treatment is medical with carbimazole, propylthiouracil, propranolol and radioiodine therapy, or surgical with a partial/total thyroidectomy.\nAnti-thyroglobulin antibody, although raised in some patients with Graves' disease, is most commonly associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland resulting in thyrotoxicosis. Rheumatoid factor is commonly raised in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and Felty's syndrome. Raised antinuclear antibody titres occur in SLE, RA, chronic active hepatitis and systemic sclerosis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) is a marker of vasculitis and occurs in two forms: cANCA directed against serine protease 3 is usually elevated in patients with Wegener's disease, whereas pANCA is directed against myeloperoxidase and elevated in systemic vasculitides such as microscopic polyangiitis."

            "explanation": "The scenario is one of haemorrhage following a thyroidectomy and formation of a tension haematoma, resulting in a compromised airway. This is a surgical emergency and requires immediate removal of the surgical clips at the bedside, followed by returning the patient to theatre to explore the area and control the haemorrhage. Although all of the other management routes are possible, it is reasonable to proceed with clip removal at the bedside as waiting for senior colleagues could result in this patient's death. Other complications of thyroidectomy are as follows:\n• Immediate – Haemorrhage, laryngeal oedema, recurrent/superior laryngeal nerve damage, tracheal damage and thyroid storm\n• Early – Reactionary haemorrhage, hypocalcaemia (secondary to parathyroid insufficiency) and infection\n• Late – Hypothyroidism, keloid scar, disease recurrence"

            "explanation": "Thyroid cancers can be either primary or secondary in origin. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid accounts for approximately 70% of primary thyroid cancers. They occur commonly in women aged 20–40 years and are usually multifocal. They are locally invasive, spreading via the lymphatic system and causing enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Prognosis is usually good with 10-year survival in patients with extrathyroid disease at 55%. Follicular carcinoma makes up 15% of thyroid malignancy, occurring again more commonly in women in the 45- to 70-year age group. It is more common in areas of endemic goitre, with tumours usually being solitary and encapsulated. They metastasize by haematogenous spread to lungs and bones. Medullary carcinoma makes up less than 10% of thyroid cancers and occurs equally in men and women. These cancers arise from the parafollicular C cells, which secrete calcitonin and can occur as part of the MEN 2 syndrome. Metastasis is via the lymph nodes. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma occurs in the elderly and is typified by a rapidly growing aggressive tumour which infiltrates locally and spreads via both lymphatic and haematogenous systems. It can present with symptoms of tracheal compression and laryngeal nerve involvement. Lymphoma is rare and usually associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis."

These cancers arise from the parafollicular C cells, which secrete calcitonin. Calcitonin acts to reduce the serum calcium and phosphate level. As a result, the calcium level could be low in this patient. Medullary carcinoma also occurs as part of the MEN 2 syndrome. Metastasis is via the lymphatic system."

It can present with symptoms of tracheal compression and laryngeal nerve involvement, resulting in a hoarse voice and shortness of breath. Treatment is with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but rarely curative given the rapid progression of the disease process. A tracheostomy may be needed, as a palliative procedure, should the patient's airway become compromised. Five-year survival is extremely poor at 14%."

            "explanation": "Eponymous conditions are an exam favourite and knowledge of some of the more common eponyms is useful in both written and clinical examinations. Virchow's node (signal node) is an enlarged, hard, left supraclavicular lymph node which can contain metastasis of an intra-abdominal mass, e.g. gastric malignancy. Battle's sign is bruising over the mastoid process following a base of skull fracture involving the petrous temporal bone. Cloquet's node refers to the most superior of the deep inguinal lymph nodes, which passes through the femoral canal. There are approximately three to five deep inguinal nodes in the body. Enlarged inguinal lymph nodes can be a sign of localized lower limb infection, systemic infection or metastases from distal carcinomas, e.g. carcinoma of the anus and vulva. Troisier's sign is the term given to enlargement of the left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node), usually secondary to advanced metastatic gastric carcinoma. Trousseau's sign of malignancy is phlebothrombosis of the superficial veins due to cancer induced blood hypercoagulability. Trousseau also gives his name to Trousseau's sign of latent tetany which may be elicited in individuals with a low serum calcium level."

            "explanation": "Eighty per cent of salivary gland calculi occur within the submandibular glands. Calculi usually occur in young to middle-aged adults and present with pain and swelling under the jaw, following obstruction of Warthin's duct, which runs through the submandibular gland and opens on the floor of the mouth. Symptoms tend to occur before, during and after eating. Pressing on the gland can produce a foul tasting fluid in the mouth, but can occasionally relieve symptoms.\nThe calculi are often composed of calcium pyrophosphate or calcium carbonate, which is thought to be secondary to fragments of toothpaste acting as a focus for stone formation. Partial obstruction of the duct will result in swelling and pain lasting from several minutes to hours, whereas complete obstruction will cause persistent swelling and infection. Treatment for stones within the intraoral part of the duct involves removal under general anaesthesia, whereas stones within the substance of the gland can require removal of the entire gland.\nStensen's duct passes through the parotid gland. The lingual nerve also passes through the submandibular gland. The trunk of the facial nerve lies between the deep and superficial parts of the parotid glands."

Multiple radiographs are then taken to show any underlying obstructions within the duct. The flushing effect of the contrast is also considered to be therapeutic and may help to remove stones from within the duct.

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common salivary neoplasm and consists of several different types of tissue. Ninety per cent of these tumours occur in the parotid gland and grow slowly over many years. They can invade locally and can recur. Treatment is by superficial parotidectomy. Adenolymphoma (Warthin's tumour) is a benign cystic tumour that contains epithelial lymphoid elements. It occurs in middle to old age, causing a soft cystic lump in the parotid gland, in a similar location to a pleomorphic adenoma. The epithelial element is thought to arise from embryonic parotid ducts that have become separated from the main duct system of the gland, whereas the lymphoid element arises from normal lymph tissue close to the developing gland. Mikulicz's and Sjögren's syndrome are autoimmune diseases that result in slow, progressive and usually painless enlargement of the salivary glands as a result of lymphoid tissue replacing the glandular tissue. The syndromes consist of enlargement of parotid/submandibular glands, enlargement of lacrimal glands causing a bulge at the outer end of the upper eyelids and narrowing of the palpebral fissures, dry mouth, dry eyes and generalized arthritis (the last two symptoms are more common in Sjögren's syndrome). Carcinoma of the parotid gland can arise anew or in a longstanding pleomorphic adenoma. Men and women are equally affected and there is a rapid enlargement of the swelling, which is painful with pain radiating to the side of the face and ear. There may be mouth asymmetry and difficulty closing the mouth, as well as involvement of the facial nerve (which passes through the parotid gland), suggesting cancer invasion into the gland."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The mumps virus is an RNA paramyxovirus spread by droplet infection. It has an incubation period of 2–3 weeks. Affected individuals are infective for 7 days before and after onset of parotid swelling. Parotid swelling is bilateral in 70% of cases. In addition to a viral prodrome, complications of mumps can include orchitis (enquiry about testicular pain is necessary), arthritis, meningitis, pancreatitis and myocarditis. Treatment is symptomatic. An immunization programme exists in the United Kingdom, in which the MMR vaccine (combining measles, mumps and rubella – all RNA viruses) is given as a single injection at 13 months and a booster at 3-5 years of age. The use of the MMR vaccine became controversial in the late 1990s due to a speculative link with autism (although this was later discredited in the medical press). This resulted in a reduced uptake of the MMR vaccine and a subsequent increase in the number of cases of mumps and associated complications."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Pilonidal abscesses occur as a result of infection of one or more pilonidal sinuses. These are short tracts leading from an opening in the skin near the top of the buttocks or natal cleft into the body. The tract is lined with granulation tissue and can get filled with hair debris and bacteria to act as a site of infection and result in abscess formation and/or recurrent sepsis. Pilonidal sinuses are more common in males (4:1), particularly among those who are more hairy and of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean origin (although the condition is not exclusive to these populations). Pilonidal sinuses present with persistent discharge of purulent or clear fluid, and recurrent infection. They can be exquisitely tender. A number of surgical techniques exist, but definitive treatment generally involves drainage of the abscess cavity and wide excision of the natal cleft. The recurrence rate after surgery can be as high as 15%. Encouraging good hygiene and advising individuals at risk to shave the affected area and back in particular reduces this risk. Antibiotics may stop an early infection but, in this scenario, drainage under general anaesthesia would be the most appropriate treatment."

            "question": "A 56-year-old priest presents with a lump at the back of his hand that has been getting larger over the past year. Although it does not trouble him, his parishioners are increasingly commenting on it after his Sunday service. On examination, there is a soft, non-tender, irregular lump on the dorsum of the hand 3 cm × 5 cm in size. It is fluctuant on movement and transilluminates, but does not reduce when pressed down. The skin moves freely over it and no other such lumps are to be found on either arm. An aspirate produces a dark gelatinous material. This is most likely a",

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "A ganglion is a cystic, myxomatous degeneration of fibrous tissue that most commonly occurs around joints, where there is a large amount of fibrous tissue. They present mostly between the ages of 20 and 60 years, growing slowly over many months. They are non-tender, spherical and smooth on the surface. They may slip between deeper structures when pressed, suggesting that the contents have reduced into a joint. The overlying skin is also freely mobile, while aspiration reveals a thick, gel-like material. Traditional therapy consists of striking the swelling with a heavy book such as a bible. However, this tends to be only a temporary measure (and also painful!), resulting in recurrence in many cases. It can also be aspirated and injected with hydrocortisone (again resulting in recurrence), but surgical excision is the definitive management. A bursa is a fluid-filled cavity occurring between tendons, bones and skin to allow easier movement between them. Rheumatoid nodules commonly occur in relation to rheumatoid arthritis, a symmetrical inflammatory disease of the joints. The presenting history is not suggestive of this condition."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Gynaecomastia is the development of breast tissue in men. Oestradiol is the growth hormone of the breast, and an increase in serum concentration results in increased breast tissue. In men, oestradiol is a derivative of the peripheral conversion of testosterone and adrenal oestrone. Gynaecomastia can be regarded as the result of reduced androgen and increased oestrogen production. There are many causes, which are classified as follows:\n• Physiological:\n• Neonatal – Secondary to ingestion of maternal oestrogens.\n• Pubertal – Up to 50% of pubertal boys may develop asymmetrical gynaecomastia, secondary to a relative oestrogen excess during this period, which resolves spontaneously in the majority of individuals. Some patients may need surgical removal of the tissue.\n• Old age.\n• Hyperthyroidism can cause an increase in oestrogen levels.\n• Liver disease results in a reduced breakdown of oestrogen-derived compounds and as a result can cause gynaecomastia in patients with advanced disease.\n• Oestrogen-producing tumours, e.g. testicular and adrenal carcinomas (these can cause increased levels of androstenedione, which is converted by aromatase into oestrone, a type of oestrogen).\n• hCG-producing tumours, e.g. testicular (Leydig cell tumour) and bronchial carcinoma.\n• Starvation/refeeding.\n• Carcinoma of the male breast.\n• Drugs account for 10%–20% of clinically significant gynaecomastia in men and include:\n• Oestrogenic drugs which increase the level of serum oestrogen, e.g. oestrogens, digoxin (digitalis), cannabis, diamorphine, omeprazole, androstenedione and imatinib mesylate.\n• Anti-androgens which reduce serum testosterone, e.g. spironolactone, cimetidine, cyproterone, ketoconazole, metronidazole and finasteride.\n• Others: Gonadotrophins (GnRH analogues used for treating prostate cancer), cytotoxic agents, methyldopa, isoniazid.\nFurosemide is a loop diuretic used for the treatment the following:\n• Oedema associated with heart failure\n• Nephrotic syndrome\n• Liver cirrhosis\n• Hypertension"

Inguinal hernias remain the commonest type of hernia in both men and women, although femoral hernias occur 4 times more commonly in women than in men. The approximate incidence of various hernias is as follows:\n• Inguinal: 78% – of which direct inguinal hernias account for approximately 25% and indirect inguinal hernias 75%\n• Incisional: 10%\n• Femoral: 7%\n• Umbilical: 3%\n• Eepigastric: 1%"

            "explanation": "Although this lump can be described as irreducible, i.e. the hernia sac cannot be returned to its containing cavity, the description is really one of a strangulated hernia. This is when the blood supply to the bowel is permanently compromised and the affected segment becomes necrotic. Obstructed hernia means that the sac contains bowel through which faeces cannot pass. However, the blood supply is usually intact and the bowel is therefore salvageable at the time of repair. Sliding hernia occurs when part of the hernia sac is formed by an intra-abdominal structure, e.g. sigmoid/descending colon on the left side or caecum/ascending colon on the right side. In a Richter's hernia, only a part of the bowel herniates, of which the blood supply can also become compromised causing necrosis."
