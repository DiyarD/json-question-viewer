            "question": "A 55-year-old man, with a 2-year history of dyspepsia, is brought to the emergency department following a sudden onset of severe epigastric pain. The pain is made worse on movement and the patient has also experienced one episode of haematemesis. On examination, the patient is cold, sweating profusely and taking shallow breaths. The abdomen is rigid and bowel sounds are absent. A plain film chest radiograph reveals free air under the diaphragm. The most likely diagnosis is",

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Free air under the diaphragm, visualised on chest radiograph, suggests that there has been perforation of a hollow viscus. In this case, the history of dyspepsia, coupled with the onset of acute sudden epigastric pain, fits in more with acute peptic ulceration rather than perforated appendicitis. Acute cholecystitis typically presents with right upper quadrant or epigastric pain. Patients are usually pyrexial and nausea/vomiting may be present. Acute pancreatitis also presents with severe epigastric or upper abdominal pain which may radiate to the back. Approximately 10% of perforated peptic ulcer cases do not reveal free air under the diaphragm on chest radiograph, making it difficult to differentiate from acute pancreatitis (CT scan of an abdomen or explorative laparotomy addresses this). Patients suffering from a myocardial infarction can present with symptoms similar to an acute abdomen and should never be excluded in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain."

Earlier that day, she was experiencing ‘on and off’ moderate pain in the umbilical area which gradually moved over to the right iliac fossa. Associated symptoms include anorexia, nausea and vomiting. On examination, the patient is pyrexial and there is rebound tenderness and guarding over the right iliac fossa. A beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin test is negative. What should you do next?",

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A very important rule to remember is that a female of childbearing age is assumed pregnant until proven otherwise. In this scenario, the results of the beta-hCG test confirm that the patient is not pregnant, also ruling out ectopic pregnancy. This patient is showing clear signs and symptoms of appendicitis and needs to have an emergency appendicectomy. Delaying surgery may lead to severe complications such as perforation resulting in generalized peritonitis and sepsis. Ultrasound can be diagnosed in the hands of the experienced but should not delay surgical intervention due to the severity of the patient's symptoms. Ultrasound of the pelvis may be done to rule out pelvic pathology if in doubt after history taking and physical examination. A plain film abdominal radiograph has been rarely shown to be useful as a diagnostic aid in appendicitis. In the hands of experienced surgeons, laparoscopy can be used as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. Therefore, making sure that this patient is sent to the theatre in the presence of a good history is the priority."

            "explanation": "This patient has testicular torsion which is common between the ages of 12 and 25; it is uncommon after this age but does sometimes occur in older adults. The pain is usually of sudden onset and may occur following mild trauma to the testis, straining and weight-bearing exercises. Lower abdominal pain is experienced because the testis retains its embryological nerve supply which, primarily, is from the T10 sympathetic pathway. Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency and when suspected, surgical exploration of the scrotum should not be delayed as the testes can infarct within hours. Although Doppler ultrasound can effectively show the integrity of the arterial blood flow to the testis, it should not delay surgical exploration."

She last opened her bowels 4 hours ago. On examination she appears dehydrated and is in pain. The abdomen is generally tender and slightly distended. Bowel sounds are increased.

The four cardinal features of small bowel obstruction are: Vomiting (occurs early in small bowel obstruction) Colicky pain (in small bowel obstruction the pain is periumbilical) Absolute constipation (not passing faeces or flatus) Abdominal distension Absolute constipation may not always be a feature if the site of obstruction is high up and is usually a late sign of small bowel obstruction. The abdominal plain film radiograph is a valuable tool and should be the first line imaging investigation in confirming the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction. Barium follow-through, colonoscopy (if mechanical obstruction is suspected, but it carries the risk of perforation) and CT scan are all helpful investigations and can be performed after the initial plain abdominal film is obtained. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is not usually helpful in diagnosing small bowel obstruction."

On examination you notice the patient is lying still, taking shallow breaths and sweating. There is marked tenderness in the epigastric and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Murphy's sign is positive and the patient is slightly pyrexial. You suspect acute cholecystitis. What is the next best step in managing this patient?",

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Acute cholecystitis can sometimes be confused with biliary colic. Unlike biliary colic (where patients writhe around in pain), patients prefer to remain still and take shallow breaths which indicate local peritonitis. Impaction of the gallbladder outlet by a stone causes the accumulation of bile, which can initiate a chemical inflammatory process within the gallbladder. Secondary bacterial infection can arise due to this inflammation and the condition may progress to acute bacterial cholecystitis. The most important next step in managing this patient is to provide pain relief and systemic antibiotics (for example, IV cefuroxime and metronidazole) to cover any superimposed infection. As the patient has been vomiting, IV fluid resuscitation would also be of benefit, but for the purpose of this question, answer A is the most appropriate option in the list. The next thing to do would be to order an ultrasound scan to confirm the diagnosis. Under conservative management, the cholecystitis will usually settle down within 24–48 hours. If this is the case, patients are discharged and asked to return after 6–8 weeks to have an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Recent literature has shown that cholecystectomy within the first 72 hours from onset of attack has the same complication rate as elective cholecystectomy (done after 6 to 8 weeks) after the inflammation has subsided. If after 72 hours from admission the patient has still not improved, then always remember the possibility of an empyema of the gallbladder, which may require percutaneous drainage."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Symptoms of pancreatitis can easily be confused with other acute abdominal conditions such as acute cholecystitis and perforated peptic ulcer. Acute abdominal pain that is relieved by leaning forward is usually associated with pancreatitis. The head and neck of the pancreas are retroperitoneal. Thus, by leaning forward, this relieves the pressure on the retroperitoneal components of the pancreas, which in turn alleviates the pain. Patients usually have fever and tachycardia. The abdomen is usually soft, but in severe and later stages of pancreatitis the patient may be lying still and the abdomen may show signs of guarding and rigidity which resemble peritonism. All options can cause serum amylase to be raised. However, the clinical symptoms and signs coupled with the raised amylase six times the upper limit of normal suggests acute pancreatitis."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Acute mesenteric ischaemia presents with a triad of symptoms: acute colicky abdominal pain, rectal bleeding and symptoms of shock which are associated with the blood loss. This condition almost always occurs in the small bowel, involving embolism or thrombosis of the mesenteric vessels. Arterial causes (e.g. emboli due to atrial fibrillation, mural thrombus after myocardial infarction, detached atheromatous plaques and reduced arterial flow due to low cardiac output owing to either heart failure or hypotension) are more common than venous (e.g. venous stasis due to portal hypertension or portal venous system thrombosis; sepsis; coagulopathies; occasionally it may be caused by a paradoxical embolus). Arterial thrombosis is more common than arterial embolism. Venous causes tend to occur in younger patients. Haemoglobin may be raised (owing to the loss of plasma volume), and the white cell count is also usually raised coupled with serum amylase. An early abdominal plain film radiograph may show a ‘gasless abdomen'. CT angiography or mesenteric angiography can be performed if the patient is stable, but this is time consuming. If the patient is unstable, the patient will usually be sent for emergency laparoscopy or laparotomy, which will reveal areas of necrotic bowel. Diverticulitis usually presents with pain and tenderness in the left iliac fossa accompanied by fever and local signs of peritonitis. The patient usually has a history of chronic constipation.

                "E. Cholangitis"
            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Murphy's sign may be a useful tool when attempting to diagnose cholecystitis. Confirmation of diagnosis depends on the combination of physical and laboratory findings, coupled with imaging studies. The patient is instructed to lie flat. Locate the right upper quadrant of the abdomen and put two fingers lightly over that area, and at the same time ask the patient to take a deep breath. If the patient experiences pain on inspiration and catches their breath, the sign is positive. As the patient breathes in, the inflamed gallbladder impacts on the examining hand, causing pain and consequently cessation of inspiration. The sensitivity of Murphy's sign has been recorded at 97.2% and the specificity at 48.3%. The positive predictive value of this test has been recorded at 70% and negative predicted value at 93.3%. In summary, these results indicate that if a positive Murphy's sign is present, this is highly suggestive of cholecystitis; and if the sign is absent, then it is highly unlikely that the patient has cholecystitis."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This patient has a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and is showing signs and symptoms of shock. The most important initial aspect of management is to establish venous access and begin fluid resuscitation. By giving IV colloid therapy, and aiming to keep systolic blood pressure less or equal to 100 mmHg, this will decrease the rate of blood volume depletion and ‘buy' some time for the patient to be sent to theatre and have the aneurysm repaired. Although all the other answers (B-E) form part of management, they do not take priority over the initial fluid resuscitation, which, if not managed promptly, may be fatal. Performing a CT scan is usually helpful and should only be done if the patient is stable. An abdominal plain film radiograph will not change the course of management and will add further delay to the patient being sent to theatre. Amylase and haemoglobin are important, but should, again, be performed once the patient is stable. Surgery for ruptured AAAs involves immediate laparotomy, clamping the aorta above the site of rupture and inserting a synthetic Dacron graft (e.g. 'tube graft' or ‘trouser graft' for aneurysms extending to the common iliac arteries). A treated ruptured AAA carries a mortality rate of approximately 41% as opposed to 100% if left untreated."

            "explanation": "Surgical site infections account for approximately 15% of nosocomial infections and are associated with a prolonged hospital stay and increased costs. A prospective randomized control trial has shown that administering prophylactic antibiotics, and starting the initial dose one hour before surgery, decreases the incidence of postoperative surgical site infections. It is also worth noting that for a majority of surgical procedures, prophylaxis should not exceed 24 hours."

            "explanation": "In general, diverticula can be described as outpouchings of serosa-covered mucosa alone through gaps in the muscularis layer where terminal blood vessels are transmitted (the weakest point where diverticula protrude). Diverticula are commonly found in the descending and sigmoid colon. Patients who have diverticula and do not experience any symptoms are said to have diverticulosis. If colonic diverticula cause symptoms (either left-sided or central colicky abdominal pain, as well as bloating coupled with constipation), the patient is said to have diverticular disease. Diverticulitis occurs when a colonic diverticulum becomes inflamed due to infection or when faeces impact within it. Classically, it presents with lower central abdominal pain which moves to the left iliac fossa, usually referred to as ‘left-sided appendicitis' due to the similar symptoms experienced in appendicitis. Accompanying symptoms include fever, vomiting, local tenderness and guarding (local peritonitis). When the inflamed diverticulum perforates (perforated diverticulitis), signs of general peritonitis develop, characterized by general abdominal rigidity and guarding. Patients may show signs of shock, and on an erect chest radiograph free air may be visible under the diaphragm."

The signs of bowel obstruction coupled with the tense, irreducible, inguinal hernia and the overlying skin being erythematous and warm suggests that this hernia is strangulated rather than obstructed. The blood supply to the contents of the hernia is cut off by pressure at the neck of the hernia. This causes ischaemic necrosis/gangrene of the hernial contents (i.e. either bowel or omentum). Symptoms of intestinal obstruction are present if the bowel is present within the hernial sac. If on the other hand, only omentum is present, bowel obstruction is not a feature with the accompanying strangulation. In this case, the patient requires immediate surgical intervention. Delaying surgery can be fatal and emergency surgery is a priority in a patient in whom a strangulated hernia is suspected."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The most likely answer here is large bowel obstruction. Pain is usually colicky in nature and is felt commonly in the suprapubic area rather than the central area of the abdomen, which is experienced in small bowel obstruction. Vomiting is usually a late sign in large bowel obstruction, but an early sign in small bowel obstruction. Absolute constipation (not passing faeces or flatus) is an early feature of large bowel obstruction, due to the lower site of obstruction, and a late feature of small bowel obstruction. Abdominal distension is marked in large bowel obstruction and may be absent or slight in small bowel obstruction depending on the level of obstruction in the small bowel. For information on appendicitis, pancreatitis and diverticular disease, please refer to answers to Questions 2, 6 and 11, respectively. Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic disorder of intestinal motility and presents as central/lower abdominal pain which is relieved by defaecation. It is accompanied by bloating, altered bowel habits (constipation alternating with diarrhoea), tenesmus (the feeling of incomplete faecal evacuation) and usually mucus production rectally."

The modified Glasgow criteria can be used for pancreatitis caused by gallstones and alcohol whereas Ranson's criteria have been validated for alcohol-induced pancreatitis and can only be fully put to use after 48 hours of onset. The modified Glasgow criteria are: • pa02 <8 kPa • Age >55 years • White cell count >15 × 109/L • Calcium <2 mmol/L • Urea >16 mmol/L • LDH >600 IU/L • AST/ALT >200 IU/L • Albumin <32 g/L • Blood glucose >10 mmol/L If three or more criteria are positive and detected within 48 hours of onset, this suggests that the pancreatitis is severe."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient is suffering from an acute complication of ulcerative colitis called toxic megacolon. Severe inflammation rendered by the ongoing ulcerative colitis leads to dilatation of the colon, especially the transverse colon. Clinical features include toxaemia (leading to pyrexia, tachycardia and hypotension), anaemia from bleeding, acute loss of water and electrolytes and progressive abdominal distension. Along with clinical features, toxic megacolon can be diagnosed on a plain film abdominal radiograph by assessing the extent of dilatation of the transverse colon. Usually if the transverse colon is dilated more than 6 cm, this is diagnostic of toxic megacolon. For information on perforated diverticulitis and large bowel obstruction, please refer to the answers to Questions 11 and 15, respectively. Toxic megacolon can also be a complication of Crohn's colitis, but in this scenario we are told that the patient already has a 10-year history of ulcerative colitis, making Crohn's colitis unlikely. Treatment involves initial fluid resuscitation, correcting electrolyte imbalances and administering high-dose steroids. Repeated abdominal plain film radiographs are conducted as part of ongoing assessment of the size of the colon. If the size of the colon is increasing despite medical therapy, surgery is indicated before perforation ensues. Surgery is usually indicated if the patient fails to improve within 24–48 hours of medical treatment or if the risks of perforation are high."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Intestinal obstruction can be broadly divided into mechanical and paralytic obstruction (also known as paralytic ileus). A paralytic ileus occurs when the intestines are in a complete state of atony. Clinical features include abdominal distension, absolute constipation, vomiting and the absence of intestinal motility (thus bowel sounds are absent). Due to the lack of intestinal movement, colicky abdominal pain is not a feature, unlike what is seen in mechanical obstruction. Postoperative abdominal surgery, peritonitis, trauma, acute pancreatitis, potassium deficiency, uraemia, anticholinergic and antidiarrhoeal drugs are some of the frequent causes of a paralytic ileus. Causes of mechanical obstruction can be divided into: • Luminal (e.g. faecal impaction, foreign body, intussusceptions, large polyps) • Intramural (e.g. congential intestinal atresia, Crohn's colitis, tumours, strictures) • Extraluminal (e.g. volvulus, adhesions, strangulated hernia, extrinsic compression also known as a ‘mass effect') A gallstone ileus can be classified as a form of luminal intestinal obstruction. This occurs when a large gallstone (usually >2.5 cm) erodes through the gallbladder wall and passes into the duodenum, through a cholecysto-duodenal fistula, which is formed due to the chronic inflammatory environment of the eroding gallstone. The stone may then go on to obstruct the terminal ileum at the ileocaecal junction."

Urethral strictures are uncommon in men and rare in women. They may arise due to recurrent infections of the urinary tract, trauma or cancer, and can be congenital. Symptoms include dysuria, decreased stream, terminal dribbling and ‘double stream' when voiding. In addition, acute urinary retention may be caused by a spinal cord lesion which would have produced severe neurological complications such as paraesthesia and paralysis depending on the level of the spinal cord lesion; a history of trauma would also be present."

Gastric dilatation and a prominent fluid level seen on the plain film chest radiograph suggest that the obstruction is due to a volvulus. The pathology has been clinically narrowed down to the stomach, making a sigmoid volvulus an unlikely possibility in this question. The causes of a gastric volvulus can be divided into congenital (e.g. paraoesophageal hernia, congenital bands, bowel malformations, pyloric stenosis) and acquired (e.g. previous gastric/oesophageal surgery, adhesion from previous abdominal surgery). If a gastric volvulus is suspected, emergency laparotomy should not be delayed so as to avoid perforation. At some centres, endoscopic manipulation is done first and if this is not successful, surgery is warranted. Perforation usually occurs secondary to ischaemia and necrosis of the stomach (caused by the twisting of the stomach). This surgical emergency is more common in adults than in children and carries a 42%–56% mortality rate."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Mesenteric adenitis refers to inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes and is regarded as the main differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis. It is more commonly a childhood illness, though occasionally seen in adults. It is often preceded by a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes, due to the effects of the viral infection, causes right iliac fossa pain (can be diffused) and tenderness as well as an accompanying fever. Symptoms of nausea, vomiting, anorexia and diarrhoea may also be experienced. A white cell count may show lymphocytosis rather than a raised neutrophil count as seen with acute appendicitis. Since the ultrasound was inconclusive, coupled with symptoms and signs paralleling acute appendicitis, the most appropriate step to take is to send the patient for an explorative laparotomy. Acute appendicitis may be mistaken for mesenteric adenitis which can lead to complications of perforation, general peritonitis and septicaemia. Usually during explorative laparotomy, the appendix will be removed (even if it is normal) so that subsequent attacks of abdominal pain of this nature are not confused with appendicitis. Treatment of mesenteric adenitis involves analgesia and observing the patient for 24 hours; symptoms usually settle down within 24 hours of onset. In severe cases, intravenous antibiotics may be given and anti-emetics for the nausea and vomiting."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Intussusception can be defined as the invagination of a portion of bowel into its own lumen. The invaginated portion of the bowel is called the intussusceptum. Common types of intussusception are ileo-ileal, ileocaecal and colocolic. This condition is common in children (the cause is idiopathic enlarged Peyer's patch) and rare in adults. After the age of 3 years certain factors can predispose to the condition such as intestinal polyps, carcinoma, intestinal lymphoma, foreign bodies or an inverted Meckel's diverticulum. It presents as intermittent abdominal colic (screaming and pallor are seen in children), vomiting, and the passage of mucus and bloody stools per rectum (sometimes referred to as red-currant jelly). On examination the child will appear pale and anxious and will be irritable. On palpation of the abdomen, a sausage-shaped mass may be felt. Plain film abdominal radiography may be normal in early stages or there may be signs consistent with bowel obstruction. Ultrasound scanning has been used in some centres, but with variable success in diagnosing intussusception. The initial steps of treatment involve the use of barium enemas per rectum and plain abdominal film radiographs (which highlight the site of intussusception). The pressure at which the barium flows through the bowel can reduce the intussusception and this can be confirmed by conducting another plain abdominal film radiograph. If this fails, surgical reduction can be carried out. If the bowel is gangrenous, resection will be carried out. The chances of bowel ischaemia and gangrene are reduced if the intussusception is reduced within 24 hours of diagnosis."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis here is renal colic caused by obstruction of the urinary tract. Commonly the obstruction is caused by calculi impacting the pelvi-ureteric junction or anywhere along the course of the ureters. Stones within the renal parenchyma of the kidney rarely produce pain but if they do, dull loin pain may be experienced. The pain is caused by dilatation, stretching and spasm of the ureters. This is an extremely painful condition and clinically presents with colicky pain which radiates from 'loin to groin'. The pain is usually so intense that patients are classically described as ‘writhing around in pain'. Associated symptoms include vomiting and sweating. In small bowel obstruction, the pain is centrally positioned and bowel sounds are usually raised (please refer to the answer to Question 4). Acute diverticulitis presents with left iliac fossa pain and tenderness with local guarding, usually with accompanying fever (please refer to the answer to Question 11).

In addition, the CT scan is able to exclude other causes of an acute abdomen and contrast media is not needed unlike IVU which may be nephrotoxic. A KUB film, although not the investigation of choice, should always be performed when the patient is admitted with symptoms of renal colic. It should be noted that a KUB film alone will detect 80% of renal stones. Ultrasound scanning, when combined with a KUB film, has been shown to be sensitive in detecting renal calculi, but not as sensitive as CT-KUB scanning.

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Pseudomembranous colitis is an infection of the colon caused by the Gram-positive anaerobic bacteria Clostridium difficile. The signs and symptoms of this condition are similar to those experienced in ulcerative, Crohn's and ischaemic colitis: watery diarrhoea (with or without blood), passing of mucus per rectum, cramping abdominal pain and fever. Toxin A, a proinflammatory enterotoxin released by C. difficile, acts as an intestinal receptor causing loosening of junctions between intestinal epithelia. Toxin B, which is also produced by this organism, is then able to pass through the loosened epithelial cell junctions and initiates an inflammatory cascade. This process ultimately leads to fluid secretion, mucosal cell injury, oedema and inflammation. The development of C. difficile infection has been associated with a history of recent or prolonged antibiotic use, increasing age and prolonged hospital stay. Diagnosis is by stool analysis; the stool cytotoxin test is highly sensitive and specific and considered to be the first line diagnostic investigation. A highly effective, but expensive, PCR testing method is also available, but due to the costs involved, stool cytotoxin testing is favoured. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy may show pseudomembrane plaque appearance (present in 50% of patients). In some cases, histological examination may be performed for confirmation. First line treatment is usually with metronidazole, or vancomycin, if the C. difficile is resistant to metronidazole. C. difficile colitis can cause toxic megacolon (see the answer to Question 17). This cannot be treated with antibiotics and therefore warrants emergency surgery."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The most appropriate investigation here is an abdominal CT scan. Barium enema evaluation was the diagnostic investigation of choice before CT scanning was introduced. The plain film abdominal radiograph, although a quick and simple imaging investigation, is not useful in diagnosing diverticular abscesses. Colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy carry a risk of perforation and may not be able to visualize the abscess and are therefore not used. Diverticular abscess could be treated with antibiotics and CT guided drainage."
