            "explanation": "- Surgical excision is the mainstay of therapy for cutaneous melanoma.\n- With respect to diagnosis, excisional biopsy is preferred, and incisional biopsy should be avoided if possible.\n- Definitive surgical excision should be performed with appropriate margins within 4 to 6 weeks of diagnosis.\n- Narrow excision margins are appropriate based on Breslow tumor thickness.\n- For in situ tumors, the recommended excision margin is 0.5 cm.\n- For tumors 2 mm or less in thickness, the recommended margin is 1 cm.\n- For tumors larger than 2 mm in thickness, the recommended margin is 2 cm.\n- Sentinel lymph node dissection allows for evaluation of the first draining lymph node in the regional lymphatic system and is a staging procedure used when palpation and diagnostic imaging (typically, ultrasound) do not suggest lymph node metastases.\n- For patients with tumors less than 1 mm in thickness, sentinel lymph node dissection is not recommended because the positivity rate for these thin tumors is extremely low.\n- Sentinel lymph node dissection is required for thickness between 1 and 2 mm.\n- In patients who have negative sentinel lymph nodes, no further lymph node surgery is indicated.\n- For patients with micrometastases in the sentinel lymph nodes, no clear survival benefit for complete lymph node dissection currently exists, and this fact should be critically discussed with patients.\n- Potential benefits of complete lymph node dissection should be discussed when larger tumor deposits (>1 mm) are Identified in the sentinel lymph node.\n- There is no therapeutic advantage for elective lymph node dissection in patients who have clinically negative lymph nodes.\n- However, if lymph node metastases are identified by physical examination or diagnostic imaging, radical lymph node dissection is standard therapy."

            "explanation": "- Colonic lymphomas are uncommon, representing less than 1% of primary colonic malignancies.\n- Large B-cell lymphoma is the most common histologic subtype.\n- Colonic lymphomas are slightly more common in men (1.5:1) and typically present in the fifth to seventh decades of life.\n- Risk factors include chronic immunosuppression and inflammatory bowel disease.\n- Common symptoms include abdominal pain and weight loss.\n- Hematochezia is also present in 20% of patients, but perforation is uncommon.\n- Thinner patients will often have a palpable mass on abdominal exam.\n- These cancers are typically right sided, with more than 70% of colonic lymphomas being proximal to the hepatic flexure.\n- The diagnosis of colonic lymphoma is obtained via colonoscopic biopsy.\n- Staging CT scan and PET scan are indicated to exclude extracolonic disease.\n- In the absence of metastasis, the initial treatment for colonic lymphoma is surgical resection.\n- Adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone improves long-term survival over surgery alone.\n- Unfortunately, recurrence rates are very high (33-75%), and patients tend to re-present with diffusely metastatic disease.\n- The median overall survival for patients who receive surgery and chemotherapy is 36 to 53 months.\n- Observation is not appropriate for patients who are fit for surgery with disease localized to the colon.\n- Chemotherapy alone is less effective than resection followed by chemotherapy.\n- Chemotherapy alone is typically used only in the presence of metastatic disease.\n- Chemoradiotherapy is used for primary lymphoma in other sites and the addition of radiation can improve local control.\n- However, external-beam radiation to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen can be morbid and is not typically used for colonic lymphomas."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Soft tissue sarcomas are a rare group of malignancies that include almost 100 different subgroups.\n- Extremity soft tissue sarcomas account for 40% of all soft tissue sarcomas, with the remainder in the retroperitoneum and abdomen.\n- Due to concerns for high local and regional recurrence rates, amputation of the limb was often recommended, but limb-sparing wide local excision in combination with multimodal therapy provides similar overall and disease-specific survival compared with amputation.\n- Each of the numerous histologic subtypes of soft tissue sarcomas has varying biologic activity.\n- Many soft tissue sarcomas have characteristic imaging findings and can be diagnosed on cross-sectional imaging.\n- If the diagnosis is not definitive with imaging, core needle or incisional biopsy can provide the histologic diagnosis.\n- Two specific subtypes are important when discussing extremity soft tissue sarcomas.\n- Both myxofibrosarcoma and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans have an infiltrative growth pattern with a higher rate of local recurrence.\n- The recommended surgical margin for both of these subtypes is 2 cm instead of the standard 1 cm.\n- The remainder of the surgical principles remain similar.\n- Several surgical principles guide the operative management of extremity soft tissue sarcomas.\n- Any core needle or incisional biopsy scars should be included in the planned excision to reduce the risk of local recurrence.\n- Most soft tissue sarcomas tumors do not require the entire muscle body to be resected; a 1-cm margin is sufficient for noninfiltrating subtypes.\n- If a neurovascular bundle is within the planned margin, the vessels and nerve should be skeletonized but left intact.\n- If the mass encases the neurovascular bundle, the tumor can be bivalved in an attempt to preserve these structures.\n- Neoadjuvant radiation therapy reduces the local recurrence rate for patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcomas; however, no survival benefit is noted.\n- This patient is a candidate for neoadjuvant radiation, but the surgical resection margins should not be reduced to 1 cm.\n- Because sarcomas have a hematogenous route of metastases, sentinel node biopsy is not appropriate in the surgical management of these patients."

            "explanation": "- Anorectal infections in healthy patients are most often treated with early drainage, often without antibiotics.\n- Outcomes are generally good.\n- By contrast, the management of such infections in neutropenic patients (e.g., patients undergoing chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation) is complex and potentially associated with mortality.\n- Treating physicians must consider factors such as chemotherapy toxicity, degree of neutropenia, immunosuppression, thrombocytopenia, and corticosteroid use.\n- Mortality rates have dropped in recent years due to the use of multidisciplinary teams that understand the disease and monitor the associated neutropenia.\n- Because of the neutropenia, pus is actually a later sign, often seen only as the neutropenia begins to resolve.\n- Accordingly, in a study of 100 patients with neutropenia-associated anorectal infection, the most common symptom (90%) was pain, often occurring 2 to 3 days earlier than other more typical symptoms such as swelling (30%) and drainage (25%).\n- Because of this early absence of the typical findings of an abscess, MRI is preferred over ultrasound or CT scan for imaging.\n- MRI is better at showing edema and fistulous tracts.\n- Early antibiotic therapy is the standard of care.\n- Because most infections in these patients are mixed, initial antibiotic regimens should be broad spectrum and cover Gram-positive, Gramnegative, anaerobic, and fungal organisms.\n- Surgical drainage is reserved for later in the patient's course when neutropenia resolves and abscesses or fluid collection develop.\n- Surgical incisions at this time are usually smaller and localized.\n- Earlier surgical exploration was often associated with larger incisions, creating wound management problems.\n- With this multidisciplinary and reverse sequence approach to anorectal sepsis in neutropenic patients, mortality rates have fallen dramatically, although deaths still occur, especially in patients in whom the neutropenia does not resolve."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Historically, the recommendation for adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer was made based on clinicopathologic features, including patient age, tumor size, nodal status, and grade.\n- Over the last 20 years, the importance of the biologic features of the tumor, specifically the presence or absence of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and Her2/neu receptor (HER2), have become increasingly clear.\n- The ER/PR/HER2 receptor status is now a major determinant of the need for adjuvant chemotherapy.\n- Antiestrogen therapy, by blocking estrogen receptors on tumor cells and thus preventing signaling stimulating proliferation or by suppressing the production of native estrogen, is very effective in limiting tumor growth, improving survival, and decreasing recurrence in ER positive breast cancer.\n- Similarly, anti-HER2 therapies (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab) are routinely used for tumors that overexpress HER2.\n- These therapies have led to dramatic improvements in survival for patients with HER2+ breast cancer.\n- The interest in immune- and targeted-therapy has encouraged the search for additional biomarkers that might lead to the development of additional therapeutic options.\n- Oncotype DX® is a tissue-based analysis of 21-genes developed and validated to predict 10-year risk of distant recurrence in women with node negative, ER+/ HER2-breast cancer.\n- Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to quantitate RNA found in formalin-fixed paraffin blocks, obviating the need for fresh or fresh-frozen tissue and thus expanding its utility.\n- From a pool of 250 candidate genes identified in the medical literature, 16 genes were selected based on their ability to predict clinical outcome among patients treated in the NSABP B14 and B20 trials.\n- Five genes were associated with proliferation/antiapoptosis: 4 representing the hormonal signaling pathway; 2 associated with tumor invasion; 2 linked to HER2; and 1 each related to detoxification, macrophage function, and apoptosis.\n- The quantitative analysis of RNA was then normalized to the expression of 5 reference genes, allowing the development of a formula that generates a recurrence score of 0 to 100.\n- The 21-gene recurrence score provides a point estimate for the 10-year risk of distant disease recurrence with a 95% confidence interval, assuming that the patient completes 5 years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.\n- Based on the analysis of patients treated in NSABP B20, a trial of endocrine therapy alone versus endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer, patients with a low recurrence score (<18) do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.\n- Patients with a high recurrence score (>31) achieve a significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.\n- The benefit of chemotherapy in patients with intermediate recurrence score (18-30) remains controversial and may depend on the age or menopausal status of the patient.\n- A recent large prospective clinical trial confirmed that recurrence scores of 10 or less in node-negative patients are associated with a 5-year disease-free survival of more than 98% with endocrine therapy alone.\n- The data are reported as shown in figure 15.1.\n- In the NSABP B-20 study, relatively few patients had a Recurrence Score result > 50.\n- The chemotherapy benefit for these patients is expected to be at least as great as it is for those with Recurrence Score results = 50.\n- Two important observations emerged from the available data: (1) the use of the 21-gene recurrence score avoids adjuvant chemotherapy in a group of patients unlikely to derive benefit, and (2) the assay identifies patients likely to gain benefit from adjuvant therapy who might otherwise not be offered it based on traditional clinicopathologic features.\n- The 21-gene recurrence score has also been incorporated into the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system such that any patient with an ER+/HER2-/node-negative breast cancer with a recurrence score of less than 11 is staged as prognostic stage IA breast cancer, regardless of tumor size.\n- Other gene expression assays are available (e.g., Mammaprint®, genomic grade index, and EndoPredict®), but only the Oncotype DX® is validated as a tool to predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.\n- A prospective study, POsitive Node, Endocrine Responsive Breast Cancer (PONDERx) trial, by the Southwestern Oncology Group is an ongoing evaluation of the 21-gene analysis in HR+/HER2-/ node-positive (1-3) women with a recurrence score of 25 or less.\n- Results are anticipated in 2022.\n- p53 is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the TP53 gene.\n- Mutations are found in many tumors, including breast cancer, that render the p53 protein ineffective.\n- Current data are lacking to determine whether p53 alone is sufficient to use in clinical decision-making regarding prognosis.\n- No clinical evidence exists regarding this marker's ability to predict benefit from adjuvant therapy.\n- As such, it is not included in any of the guidelines for the management of breast cancer.\n- Ki-67 is a protein expressed on cell membranes during the S-phase (proliferative) of the cell cycle.\n- The level of evidence for the use of this marker for prognosis is mostly level II.\n- Ki-67 levels are highest in triple-receptor negative breast cancers.\n- Lack of standardization for laboratory identification and the high false-negative and false-positive rates, approximately 25% each, render it unsuitable as an independent marker for prognosis.\n- Like other markers, data are lacking for its utility in predicting response to chemotherapy.\n- Its use is not included in the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines.\n- BRCA1/BRCA2 genes have great utility in predicting a woman's life-time risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer and might serve to influence the decision regarding preventive interventions, the decision for prophylactic surgery, or the extent of therapeutic surgical intervention.\n- Obviously, the determination of BRCA gene mutation status is important information for family members who may also be at risk and are considering genetic testing.\n- BRCA gene mutations do not provide useful information for decision-making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy.\n- PD-L1 (programmed death ligand 1) is a receptor that has generated significant interest recently.\n- It is commonly in the medical community but also among lay persons due to the commercialization of targeted therapy touted in the media.\n- PD-L1 is present in many tissues.\n- When present on tumor cells, it binds to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells, inhibiting T-cell destruction of the tumor tissue.\n- It is most commonly expressed in triple-negative breast cancers, but only 20% of the time.\n- PD-L1 identification has not been used as a prognostic marker for breast cancer or as an indicator of the benefit of chemotherapy."
