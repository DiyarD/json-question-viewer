            "question": "A 51-year-old patient presents with abdominal distention, nausea, and bilious vomiting 2 years after a cholecystectomy. He has not passed flatus for the last day. The patient is afebrile with normal vital signs. Exam demonstrates mild distention, tympany, and mild tenderness. A complete blood count is within normal limits. An abdominal CT scan is obtained, and the radiologist reports a small bowl dilation and a transition point with no other abnormalities. What is the appropriate next step?",

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- The dictum that the sun neither rises nor sets on a small bowel obstruction is sometimes not appropriate because some patients do not present with worrisome physiology such as fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, tachycardia, or peritoneal signs on physical exam.\n- Many small bowel obstructions resolve without surgical intervention.\n- Recent data from a retrospective review and prospective trial suggest that absent signs of obstipation for more than 12 hours, CT scan findings of mesenteric edema, and fecalization of the small bowel, a Gastrografin challenge can be used to predict the need for operative management.\n- This test uses 100 mL of water-soluble contrast, diluted with 50 mL of water, and infused via a gastric tube.\n- An abdominal radiograph is taken 8-hours later. Visualized contrast in the colon suggests a nonobstructed small bowel and strongly predicts the ability to avoid surgery.\n- Peritonitis or other signs of strangulated bowel should prompt immediate surgery. Likewise, the presence of fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, or tachycardia suggests the bowel is at risk for ischemia and should also prompt abdominal exploration. In this patient, such features were not reported, and an initial nonoperative evaluation with Gastrografin is appropriate.\n- A contrast enema is not helpful because contrast is limited to the large intestine and would not interrogate the small bowel.\n- CT enterography, although possible, is time-consuming and not used in the acute setting.\n- Diagnostic laparoscopy would not be indicated because the initial approach is nonoperative.\n- Once the decision is made to intervene operatively, the next decision is whether to proceed in an open or laparoscopic fashion. This decision will depend on the patient presentation and the surgeon's expertise in laparoscopic surgery."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that results in the thickening of many normally thin secretions throughout the body.\n- Pulmonary toilet of these thick secretions is a lifelong challenge and results in frequent infections.\n- The disease also causes abnormal pancreatic and intestinal function, which at times results in thickened small bowel succus and fecal material.\n- Because this material can be difficult to pass through the gastrointestinal tract, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of constipation or even large or small bowel obstructions.\n- Supplemental digestive enzymes can prevent this from occurring.\n- When intestinal obstruction results from thickened succus or fecal material (sometimes called meconium), imaging will show heavy stool burden distal to the dilated or obstructive-appearing intestinal loops.\n- Laparotomy or laparoscopy with or without resection is the last solution.\n- Gastrografin, a water soluble contrast, can pull fluid into the intestinal lumen relieving the obstruction caused by the inspissated meconium. Repeated applications are sometimes required.\n- In this case, the diagnosis was made by CT scan. Further imaging, such as ultrasound or CT enterography, is not indicated."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Colon cancer screening recommendations are evolving to improve patient compliance.\n- Colonoscopy remains the current standard screening modality.\n- Because more than 99% of diminutive polyps are benign, use of less invasive, more economical approaches to the management of patients at low risk for malignancy with polyps smaller than 1 cm are being assessed.\n- Proposed strategies include removing and discarding diminutive polyps given the low incidence of advanced histologic features in less than 3% of such lesions, as well as less frequent exams.\n- Repeat colonoscopy before 10 years after a negative, uncompromised colonoscopy appears to offer little benefit.\n- CT colonography is increasingly popular as a screening tool.\n- Sensitivity for detection of adenomas of at least 6 mm is 80%, although radiologists do not routinely report lesions detected by CT colonography that are smaller than 6 mm.\n- The current recommendation is that polyps 6 to 9 mm, although likely to be benign, be removed by colonoscopy or followed with a second CT colonography in 3 years.\n- For lesions larger than 10 mm, sensitivity approaches 88%.\n- Sessile polyps can be difficult to identify by colonoscopy or CT colonography due to their flat morphology, primarily in the cecum. However, with careful preparation and attention to evidence of contrast adherence to the mucosa, identification of these worrisome lesions can match screening colonoscopy.\n- Patient compliance may be greater for CT colonographic screening, but colonoscopy remains the only available one-step approach to colorectal cancer screening.\n- Stool DNA tests are becoming widely available. These tests detect tumor-associated genetic and epigenetic markers in cells shed in the stool.\n- A recent cross-sectional study showed a sensitivity of 92% for a multitarget stool DNA for detecting colorectal cancer in a screening population, but it is less sensitive (42%) for detecting advanced adenomas.\n- Fecal occult testing (FIT) has a 74% sensitivity for colorectal cancer and 24% for advanced adenomas.\n- Specificity of the FIT for nonadvanced or negative findings is superior to stool DNA testing (96.4% vs 89.8%).\n- Given its false-positive rate and current cost, stool DNA testing has not supplanted FIT testing in the screening of low-risk patients."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Cystic lesions of the pancreas are commonly identified on abdominal imaging, and questions regarding their management often fall to the surgeon.\n- Distinguishing the benign from malignant lesion (or potentially malignant lesion) and recommending appropriate management requires an understanding of the natural history of these lesions and an individual patient's oncologic risk.\n- Although it is widely acknowledged that cyst size greater than 3 cm is a significant risk factor for malignancy in mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), these solitary tumors typically occur in the body and tail of the pancreas and are not in communication with the main pancreatic duct.\n- Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), by definition, do communicate with the pancreatic duct.\n- Surgical resection is recommended for all main duct IPMN.\n- Worrisome features for a branch duct IPMN include lesion size greater than 3 cm, thickened enhancing cyst walls, a nonenhancing solid component, an associated dilated main pancreatic duct, or an abrupt change in main pancreatic duct caliber with distal pancreatic atrophy and lymphadenopathy.\n- Analysis of cyst contents obtained via endoscopic ultrasound is being studied as a means of distinguishing malignant from more benign lesions.\n- Although elevated serum CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) are highly specific biomarkers associated with invasive pancreatic malignancy, cyst CEA levels alone cannot reliably discern benign from malignant and are variably present in both MCNs and IPMNs.\n- Similarly, cyst amylase offers limited distinctions.\n- Cyst fluid cytology can accurately diagnose a malignant pancreatic cyst lesion, but sensitivity is hampered by low cellular volume in mucous.\n- The cytologic features of IPMNs and MCNs may be similar, each showing mucinous neoplastic epithelial cells.\n- Immunohistochemical analysis of mucous can distinguish the different histopathologic origin of an IPMN (e.g., differentiating gastric from intestinal or pancreatobiliary IPMNs), pancreatic mucin gene expression patterns, specific genetic mutations, and microRNA analyses remain under investigation as predictors of invasive cancer."

            "explanation": "- Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are placed for durable feeding access across a wide spectrum of diseases.\n- The published complication rate is between 0.5 and 20%, with minor complications predominating.\n- Typical complications associated with PEG tubes include those related to insertion and long-term maintenance.\n- Insertion-related complications include bleeding, hollow viscous or hepatic injury, and tumor seeding of the insertion site (seen in head and neck cases).\n- Complications from long-term maintenance include abscess formation (including necrotizing soft tissue infections), distal tube migration, skin breakdown, and buried bumper syndrome (BBS; figure 12.3).\n- BBS occurs when the PEG fixation flange slowly migrates out of the intragastric space and into either the wall of the stomach or the anterior abdominal wall.\n- Typically, the stomach remains adherent to the abdominal wall and the presentation is an inability to administer feeds, with leakage around the PEG tube site.\n- This complication is often seen after several months but can be seen as early as 3 weeks after placement.\n- The etiology is likely due to too much tension on the flange causing slow erosion anteriorly of the bumper.\n- The first step in management is to determine the etiology of the tube malfunction.\n- Adherence of the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall should be confirmed.\n- Patients with peritonitis, free air, or other findings consistent with an intra-abdominal leak should be explored.\n- For a true BBS, management can either be endoscopic or fluoroscopic.\n- If the flange is partially visible on endoscopy, an attempt can be made to push it into the gastric lumen and then a new tube can be placed.\n- Alternatively, as in the case pictured, with axial evidence of the tube completely retracted into the abdominal wall, the tube should be removed, and the stomach can be accessed fluoroscopically to replace the tube or another percutaneous feeding tube can be placed.\n- If there is significant tissue breakdown, the patient may require a period of wound healing before replacing the tube.\n- In the interim, the patient can be maintained on nasoenteric feeds, if necessary.\n- Cutting the tube flush to the skin will not address the problem and will likely lead to an abdominal wall abscess.\n- This technique, described as \"cut and leave,\" is reserved for only the direst of circumstances and patients without signs of local or systemic inflammation.\n- Most patients, even those who are unable to tolerate any operative intervention, can have their tube removed at the bedside.\n- Wide local debridement is necessary only if there is significant tissue destruction, abscess, or concern for a necrotizing process."

            "explanation": "- After resuscitation and stabilization, most lower gastrointestinal bleeds can be managed endoscopically.\n- Colonoscopy is not only feasible but also safe and often therapeutic for the management of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeds.\n- Several studies confirmed this finding.\n- Despite advances in vascular and interventional radiology, endoscopy should be the first step in the diagnostic algorithm for lower gastrointestinal bleeds.\n- Most lower gastrointestinal bleeds subside soon after presentation, so colonoscopy is often performed after a rapid colon purge.\n- A rapid bowel preparation is safe and allows for a more thorough examination of the colon, facilitating any therapeutic measures.\n- Early colonoscopy decreases hospital length of stay.\n- Therapeutic endoscopy includes epinephrine injection, thermal probe coagulation, and hemoclips placement.\n- In one large study, no patient undergoing colonoscopic intervention for diverticular bleeds demonstrated a rebleed within the 3-year study period. This number was compared with 50% seen in historic controls where no endoscopic therapeutic maneuver was performed.\n- For patients failing endoscopic management, both endovascular and surgical options exist.\n- Superselective angioembolization (SSAE) is an option available to avoid surgical resection.\n- Although the technical success rate of SSAE is documented at greater than 90%, one in 5 patients will go on to require surgical resection.\n- The overall ischemic complications are low, ranging from 0 to 5% in the literature.\n- This low rate is thought to be likely multifactorial and includes the use < very small microcatheters to restrict the embolization only to the distal arcades in the bleeding territory."

It appears to be superior to vancomycin in all of the randomized studies.\n- Probiotics containing lactobacillus or other multiorganism mixes reduce the rate of C. difficile-related infections.\n- Robust data demonstrating these agents as a method of reducing subsequent infections after a treatment course are lacking.\n- Probiotic agents are not indicated for the treatment of an acute C. difficile infection (recurrent or otherwise.)"

This device resects and fixes the internal hemorrhoid tissues to the adjacent rectal wall.\n- The staple line is above the dentate line, which produces less pain than a surgical hemorrhoidectomy.\n- Rectal prolapse and tenesmus are higher with stapled hemorrhoidopexy.\n- This approach is associated with less pain, less operating room time, and more rapid return to normal activity.\n- Patients who had a stapled hemorrhoidopexy have an earlier return to work.\n- Specific complications are associated with stapled hemorrhoidopexy. These include failure of the staple gun, urosepsis, and pelvic sepsis with rectal perforation.\n- The most common complication of stapled hemorrhoidopexy is early bleeding.\n- Late complications include fecal incontinence and proctitis.\n- Tenesmus is more common in stapled hemorrhoidopexy than in other methods of hemorrhoidectomy.\n- Tenesmus is most likely from the presence of a low rectal suture.\n- Septic complications are more common after stapled hemorrhoidectomy compared with all other techniques.\n- The incidence of incontinence of feces and flatus is not lower with stapled hemorrhoidopexy compared with open hemorrhoidectomy."

            "explanation": "- Aortoenteric fistula (AEF) is a potentially life-threatening condition arising after prosthetic graft placement for treatment of aortic disease (i.e., aneurysmal repair, bypass grafting).\n- Up to 70% of patients present initially with gastrointestinal bleeding, although hypovolemic shock, sepsis, and abdominal pain with general malaise can occur.\n- Exsanguinating hemorrhage is often preceded by a minor \"herald bleed,\" which is self-limited secondary to vasoconstriction and thrombus formation at the site of the AEF.\n- Herald bleeds can occur from hours to months before massive hemorrhage.\n- The duodenum is the most common enteric site for an AEF, with more than half of cases occurring at this site, followed by the jejunum and ileum.\n- Prompt diagnosis is key to survival.\n- Although upper endoscopy is undertaken to rule out other etiologies of bleeding in hemodynamically normal patients, it is not a very sensitive or specific modality for identifying AEF.\n- CT angiography, conversely, has a reported sensitivity approaching 94%, especially when considering findings associated with AEF.\n- Such criteria include ectopic gas (i.e., air between the aorta and duodenum), perigraft fluid, perigraft soft tissue attenuation (i.e., loss of a distinct interface between aorta and bowel), focal bowel wall thickening, and the presence of a pseudoaneurysm.\n- Given such sensitivity, it is the diagnostic modality of choice in hemodynamically abnormal patients with prior aortic prosthetic graft placement and suspected AEF.\n- Colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasonography, and tagged red blood cell nuclear scintigraphy have very poor sensitivity and specificity in identifying AEFs.\n- Although complete graft excision with oversewing of the aortic stump was the standard of care for AEF, treatment is evolving toward staged therapy involving endovascular stent placement followed by open repair."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Ingestion of strong alkali bases, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) can produce severe esophageal burns and necrosis (caustic injury).\n- Although sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is a strong alkali, ingestion of hypochlorite-only solutions, such as household bleach, typically cause only minor damage to the esophagus such as first-degree burns or hyperemia.\n- Bleach ingestion only rarely produces severe complications such as perforation or stricture, usually with large volume ingestions.\n- Attempts to use neutralizing agents in caustic injury should be avoided because they may generate exothermic reactions and further injury.\n- Most accidental caustic ingestions produce mild injuries from which patients recover without complications.\n- Large ingestions are usually associated with suicide attempts and produce more severe injuries. These can cause death from hemorrhage, gastrointestinal perforation with sepsis, pulmonary injury, and aortoenteric fistulae in the first 2 to 3 weeks after ingestion.\n- Long-term complications include gastrointestinal fistulae and pharyngeal, esophageal, and gastric strictures that compromise nutritional status.\n- Initial management of the patient may require a critical care environment with endotracheal intubation and ventilation available.\n- Multiple-agent ingestions (alcohol, drugs, other poisons) are common.\n- Initial assessment usually includes evaluation of the injury via esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\n- Caustic injury of the esophagus begins within minutes and may persist for hours.\n- Clinical evidence of esophageal perforation is usually delayed, possibly as a result of transmural ischemia and subsequent necrosis due to alkali-induced arteriolar and venous thrombosis of the esophageal wall."

            "explanation": "- Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion is commonly performed in patients who have long-term issues with oral intake, such as neurologic conditions.\n- Complication rates of PEG vary from 0.4 to 22.5% of cases, with major complications occurring in one-third of total complications.\n- Button gastrostomies are popular in pediatric patients and may be safely placed as initial gastrostomy or to replace an existing PEG.\n- This is a low-profile device that may be preferable in mobile adult patients on intermittent feeds where a standard PEG may be at risk of being pulled out.\n- The \"buried bumper\" syndrome is reported in 1% of PEG tube insertions, so-called because the internal fixation device migrates into the tract of the stoma and outside of the stomach.\n- This can result in obstruction of the PEG or leakage of tube feeds into the abdominal wall or peritoneal cavity with possible infection, including necrotizing infections, peritonitis, and sepsis.\n- Buried bumper syndrome is thought to be caused by excess compression of tissue between the external and internal fixation device of the PEG tube.\n- Skin sutures on the external flange of the PEG alone will not prevent buried bumper syndrome.\n- Avoiding excess tension or laxity of the PEG flanges during and after insertion and demonstration of the \"PEG swirl\" sign (twisting mucosa with rotation of the PEG tube) during insertion gastroscopy are proposed avoidance measures.\n- Perioperative antibiotics for PEG tube insertion are recommended because a meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant reduction (50-75%) in the incidence of peristomal infection with administration of prophylactic antibiotics.\n- Early dislodgement of a PEG tube is usually described as less than 14 days after initial insertion.\n- Dislodgement carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality because the stomach may separate from the abdominal wall and leak gastric contents and tube feeds into the peritoneal cavity.\n- Peritonitis usually requires open laparotomy to perform gastrostomy closure, irrigation and drainage of the peritoneal cavity, and placement of an open gastrostomy.\n- After 14 days, the PEG tube tract is usually mature, and dislodgement is considered late.\n- At this point, the tube can be inserted back through the tract and position confirmed by contrast fluoroscopy or CT scan.\n- Ultrasound is used to avoid PEG insertion complications, and it may reveal the cause of unsuccessful transillumination of the abdominal wall due to intervening structures such as the left lobe of the liver."
