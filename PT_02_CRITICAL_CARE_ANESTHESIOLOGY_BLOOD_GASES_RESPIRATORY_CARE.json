            "explanation": "- The most common cause of hypoxemia is ventilation-perfusion inequality, even though hypoventilation, incomplete oxygen diffusion, and pulmonary shunts also cause hypoxemia.\n- Mismatch of ventilation and blood flow occurs to some degree in a normal upright lung but can become extreme in diseased lungs.\n- Indices for measuring ventilation-perfusion inequality include alveolar-arterial Po₂ difference, physiologic shunt (venous admixture), and alveolar dead space.\n- Elevated 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) levels shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the right, augmenting tissue oxygenation, but this elevation does not cause hypoxemia."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- The oxygen dissociation curve's shape offers physiological advantages.\n- The relatively flat slope above a Po₂ of 50 pKa means hemoglobin saturation decreases slightly with modest Po₂ decrements, minimally affecting alveolar oxygen loading with mild to moderate hypoxemia.\n- The steeper slope at the lower end ensures that as hemoglobin desaturates, arterial Po₂ drops minimally, maintaining a gradient favoring oxygen diffusion into tissue cells.\n- Acidosis, a rise in Paco₂, and elevated temperature shift the curve to the right, enhancing tissue oxygen uptake.\n- Red blood cell organic phosphates, especially 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), also influence the dissociation curve.\n- Banked blood, being low in 2,3-DPG, shifts the curve to the left, decreasing tissue oxygen uptake.\n- 2,3-DPG levels increase with chronic hypoxia.\n- Chronic lung disease shifts the curve to the right, enhancing oxygen delivery to peripheral tissues."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- The patient is suffering from acute, life-threatening respiratory acidosis, compounded by a central nervous system depressant.\n- While hypoxemia needs correction, the immediate priority is to correct acidosis caused by carbon dioxide accumulation.\n- Both disturbances can be resolved by skilled endotracheal intubation and ventilatory support.\n- Sodium bicarbonate and high-flow nasal oxygen are inappropriate.\n- Bicarbonate should not be given as buffer reserves are adequate (serum bicarbonate 34 meq/L).\n- Nasal oxygen is not warranted because acidemia and hypoxemia stimulate spontaneous ventilation.\n- Headache, confusion, and papilledema indicate acute carbon dioxide retention, not a structural intracranial lesion."

            "explanation": "- Dopamine has diverse pharmacological properties useful in critically ill patients.\n- At low doses (1–5 mg/kg/min), dopamine primarily activates dopaminergic receptors, causing vasodilation of renal and mesenteric vasculature and mild peripheral vasoconstriction, redirecting blood flow to kidneys and bowel.\n- At low doses, the net effect on overall vascular resistance is slight.\n- As the dose increases (2–10 mg/kg/min), β₁-receptor activity predominates, leading to increased cardiac output and blood pressure due to inotropic effects on the myocardium.\n- Above 10 mg/kg/min, α-receptor stimulation causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shifting blood from extremities to organs, decreasing kidney function, and causing hypertension.\n- Diastolic blood pressure is expected to rise at all doses, increasing coronary blood flow as coronary perfusion largely depends on the pressure at the coronary ostia."

            "explanation": "- Securing a stable airway is fundamental in managing severely injured patients, with control levels varying from simple oropharyngeal airways to tracheostomy.\n- Full airway control should be established in the emergency room for unstable patients.\n- Endotracheal intubation is usually the preferred method, but tracheotomy should be prepared if peroral or pernasal intubation fails or is impractical due to maxillofacial injuries.\n- The period just before and during initial airway control attempts is most dangerous.\n- Oronasopharyngeal manipulation can provoke combativeness or vomiting in patients confused by drugs, alcohol, hypoxia, or cerebral trauma.\n- Aspiration risk is high during these attempts; no assumptions should be made about stomach contents.\n- Antacids are recommended before intubation if feasible.\n- Steroids, previously recommended for acidic gastric aspiration, are no longer considered valuable.\n- Best management involves preventing aspiration complications.\n- For cooperative patients, awake intubation with topical anesthesia helps avoid hypotension, arrhythmia, and aspiration risks associated with anesthesia induction.\n- If awake intubation is inappropriate, rapid-sequence induction with a thiobarbiturate followed by muscle paralysis with succinylcholine is an alternative.\n- Awake intubation is contraindicated if elevated intracranial pressure or penetrating eye injury is suspected."

            "explanation": "- Nitrous oxide (N₂O) is a common inhalation analgesic, but its high minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC > 100) means true anesthesia at 1 atm cannot be achieved without compromising oxygen delivery. Being 30 times more soluble than nitrogen in blood, N₂O enters trapped air faster than nitrogen leaves, increasing trapped air volume, which can worsen bowel obstruction.\n- Halothane is a potent anesthetic (MAC 0.75) causing cardiovascular depression through various mechanisms, including direct myocardial muscle and peripheral vascular smooth muscle depression, and effects on medullary vasomotor centers and sympathetic ganglionic transmissions, leading to hypotension and decreased cardiac output.\n- Enflurane, a halogenated inhalation anesthetic (MAC 1.2), is similar to halothane but can induce electroencephalographic changes resembling epilepsy in some normal patients.\n- Methoxyflurane is the most potent and least volatile halogenated inhalation anesthetic (MAC 0.16), but its clinical use is limited by high nephrotoxicity risk from fluoride ions released during biodegradation.\n- Morphine, a potent narcotic, can potentiate analgesic effects of inhalation agents during general anesthesia and may cause histamine release, risking hypotension if given in a large bolus."
