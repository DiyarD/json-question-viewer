            "question": "You are asked to review a 45-year-old man on the surgical ward by the nursing staff. Checking through the notes, you observe that he is 1 day following an open anterior resection for rectal carcinoma. He describes severe central abdominal pain associated with dyspnoea. The abdomen is soft but generally tender throughout. His symptoms have occurred despite an epidural that was inserted prior to surgery. What is the most effective form of analgesia in this setting?",
            "options": [
                "A. Four-hourly intramuscular morphine",
                "B. Patient-controlled opiate analgesia (PCA)",
                "C. Intravenous paracetamol",
                "D. Per rectum diclofenac",
                "E. Intravenous oxycodeine hydrochloride"
            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient is 1 day following a major bowel resection. The best form of analgesia in this setting is an epidural; however, this appears not to be functioning. Hence, a PCA system is indicated. This mode of delivery has been shown to be effective for control of postoperative pain. In addition, it reduces the risk of development of basal atelectasis and other respiratory complications. The drawback with PCA is that it requires a level of patient cooperation and understanding, and the patient has to be able to use the device. Intravenous oxycodeine hydrochloride and intramuscular morphine are strong and effective analgesics. The rationale for preferring PCA is that it has been shown to provide a superior background of analgesia, with fewer episodes of breakthrough pain. The parental opioid administration is preferred in patients who are less suitable for PCA, that is those unable to understand instructions, those under sedation and those with vision impairment or mobility/coordination issues. Paracetamol and diclofenac are simple analgesics, which you are told have not relieved the patient's pain. These drugs may be appropriate to use in conjunction with a PCA system or other morphine analgesia, although candidates must be aware that PR drugs should be strictly avoided in patients with a recent low rectal resection."

            "question": "A 64-year-old man undergoes a laparoscopic gastric bypass for obesity. His baseline blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg. Intraoperatively, there was a small serosal tear which was sutured laparoscopically. The patient had some bleeding during the dissection of the lesser omentum, which was controlled with diathermy. The patient did not require intraoperative transfusion. Postoperatively on return to the high dependency unit, the patient is mechanically ventilated and his blood pressure is 80/40 mmHg. His urine output is 15 mL/h. Which of the following is the best means of improving his urine output?",
            "options": [

                "E. Give a fluid challenge and monitor the clinical response"
            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "In a surgical patient, it is typically safe to assume that the cause of postoperative hypotension is hypovolaemia until proved otherwise. This patient may be suffering from a reactionary haemorrhage from a vessel within the lesser omentum. The most appropriate management plan would be to give a fluid challenge and monitor the clinical response while simultaneously checking the full blood count and clotting. Inotropic support with drugs such as noradrenaline and dobutamine is the reserve of patients who are fluid replete but who still struggle to maintain their urinary output. Use of these drugs might be indicated once there is confirmation that the patient is adequately filled. There is little value to be gained from inserting a Swan-Ganz catheter, unless there is a clear cardiac cause for shock. Insertion of pulmonary artery catheters is controversial and some studies even suggest their use is associated with increased mortality. Furosemide may play a role in the management of a patient with low urine output and fluid overload but not in cases of hypovolaemia."

            "question": "A 46-year-old woman re-presents to the emergency department 48 hours following an ‘uncomplicated' laparoscopic cholecystectomy and on-table cholangiogram. She describes a history of progressive, constant, right upper quadrant pain radiating to the shoulder tip since the surgery. The pain is worse on coughing and moving. On direct questioning, she describes a 24-hour history of nausea and vomiting. The abdomen is rigid. Her liver function tests are abnormal as follows: bilirubin 60 µmol/L, alkaline phosphatase 550 IU/L and alanine aminotransferase 220 IU/L. Her international normalized ratio is <1.5.

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This question requires careful consideration because of its wording: ‘Which single investigation is more likely to be diagnostic'. An urgent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will reveal a small amount of free air secondary to the recent laparoscopy and free fluid; however, it would not be able to determine the source of the fluid. In this setting, ERCP would be required to determine the site of a leak and a CT would help in the assessment. If the question had asked which investigation is likely to be performed first, the correct answer might be a CT or ultrasound scan. Optimal care would be for a scan to confirm a collection followed by an operation to identify a cause. The most likely diagnosis in this case is of a biliary leak (commonly secondary to either slipped Ligaclip, a high pressure ductal system, or a duct of Luschka). An erect chest plain film radiograph is an appropriate investigation in the work-up of a patient with an acute abdomen, but in this setting it is likely to reveal a small amount of free air secondary to the recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Urgent amylase or lipase levels should be performed as a matter of routine to exclude pancreatitis secondary to the on-table cholangiogram. However, pancreatitis is unlikely to be the cause of this patient's peritonism or subphrenic irritation. Urine Ketostix to detect ketonuria should be performed as part of the assessment. It is likely to show dehydration-associated ketonuria, but this will not aid the diagnosis."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "It is likely that this patient has had an umbilical port-site bleed/ haematoma (not uncommon following laparoscopic procedures). Subsequent blood loss and anaemia are the likely precipitant of the angina-like chest pain and dyspnoea. Note that atherosclerosis is more common in retroviral-positive individuals, and they are therefore at increased risk of underlying undiagnosed cardiovascular disease. Treating the cause of the anaemia is likely to be the most important step. It may be appropriate to call a cardiologist and ultimately commence a GTN infusion, although GTN should be avoided in haemodynamic compromise as it can cause profound hypotension. Heparin should be used cautiously in patients with thrombocytopenia and the advice of a haematologist should be sought."

The patient is at risk of pulmonary atelectasis, but this would be a more likely answer 24-48 hours postoperatively. An infective exacerbation of chronic airways disease is less likely in the absence of respiratory symptoms or signs and more commonly occurs as a consequence of pulmonary atelectasis between 3 and 7 days postoperatively.

First, the legal age of consent is 18 in the UK. Second, no person may consent to or refuse treatment for another person, not even the parents of the child concerned. Children aged 16-18 may consent to treatment if it is thought that they comprehend the decision they are being asked to make; the medical professional seeking consent is responsible for deciding whether this is the case. Children aged less that 18 cannot refuse treatment, although this area of law is muddied and a court order is often necessary to force treatment, with the burden of proof being on the medical professional to argue that the management is beneficial and life-saving. Although not legally required, it is good medical practice to seek the consent of the parents of the child concerned. In the event of parents refusing consent for a child to have life-saving treatment, such as an appendicectomy, medical professionals can overrule the decision of the parents if they consider treatment is undoubtedly in the child's best interest."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Venous thromboembolism is an important cause of hospital morbidity and mortality. It is estimated that between 5% and 10% of all hospital deaths are directly caused by thromboembolic complications. Post-mortem studies show up to 70% of all patients who die in hospital have some venous thrombus formation. Effective prophylaxis is therefore paramount. A systematic review published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1988 demonstrated that LMWH administration alone reduced risk of all venous thrombus formation by 67%, with a reduction in the incidence of pulmonary embolism by 47% and fatal pulmonary embolism by 64%. This question may seem confusing to candidates as most will recognize that optimal management in a patient of this age and co-morbidities undergoing hip surgery would be a combination of different prophylactic measures; a combination of LMWH and intermittent calf compression stockings would give the optimum protection. Correct answering of this question, therefore, requires knowledge of the relative efficacy of the different prophylaxis methods. According to published data, following hip surgery elasticised stockings alone reduce risk of VTE by 23%, intermittent compression stockings reduce the incidence by 63% and LMWH alone reduces the risk by 70%. Unfractionated heparin is no better at preventing VTE than LMWH, it is more difficult to administer and is associated with a greater incidence of bleeding complications. The correct answer is therefore option E."

In this scenario we are not told whether the blood was cross-matched or type specific. Non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reactions are more likely to occur >30 minutes following transfusion, and generally, the patient remains well.

A history of dementia should be sought, but is unlikely to be responsible for the acute confusion in this patient. The most common causes include dehydration and sepsis. This patient has had a urological procedure and was noted to have cloudy urine. Therefore the most likely explanation is delirium secondary to urinary tract sepsis.

            "explanation": "The patient is about to undergo a major colonic resection with risk of haemorrhage. As the indication for the warfarin therapy is atrial fibrillation, the best strategy is to admit the patient 3–5 days prior to surgery to stop the warfarin and check the INR is <1.5 the day prior to the procedure. No intervening aspirin or heparin is necessary, and indeed these may exacerbate haemorrhage at the time of surgery. Greater consideration needs to be given if the indication for warfarin is recurrent DVT/PE or metallic heart valves. These patients may require admission for conversion of warfarin to heparin injections/infusions. Guidance regarding specific circumstances varies between centres and opinion varies among surgeons. Not all surgery requires cessation of warfarin; for very minor procedures such as examinations under anaesthesia where the risk of serious bleeding is very low, there is no need to stop warfarin."

The chest radiograph may show non-specific signs (pulmonary atelectasis, elevated hemidiaphragm and pleural effusion) that are not diagnostic.

Perioperative rehydration should be generous to prevent the risk of dehydration and hepatorenal syndrome. Jaundiced patients are at increased risk of infection and therefore prophylactic antibiotics should not be withheld. The effects of opiate analgesics may be prolonged due to abnormalities with drug metabolism and first pass elimination.

The risk of postoperative reinfarction after a previous myocardial infarction is\n• 0-3 months = 35%\n• 3-6 months = 15%\n• >6 months = 4%\nThe decision is more straightforward in benign disease (vascular disease) versus carcinoma. Unfractionated heparin may be beneficial as an initial therapy in critical ischaemia.

Patients commonly have acute psychosis, typically extremely unpleasant and vivid tactile and visual hallucinations. Patients suffering withdrawal should be commenced immediately on a reducing regimen of benzodiazepines to wean or ‘detox' from alcohol. The single best drug to use is chlordiazepoxide, which is given orally. Regimens differ between centres. If oral medication is impossible, IM diazepam or lorazepam is the next drug of choice. IV infusion is inappropriate, as is prolonged administration of a set dose since the patient will simply become dependent on the benzodiazepine and require weaning from this. A septic screen is probably also indicated, but failure to treat the withdrawal will lead to further morbidity and possible mortality."
