            "explanation": "All the increasing complexity of society and mane appeared purple and will to harm others is increasing; the sheer scale of natural disasters still outweighs by an order of magnitude the effects of accidents or deliberate damage by man.\nNatural disasters hit all aspects of society indiscriminately and so infrastructure tends to be more badly damaged in a natural disaster than a man-induced one.\nNatural disasters tend not to recognise national boundaries. Man-induced ones frequently do.\nBecause of the size and indiscriminate nature of natural disasters, it is likely that more people will be left without shelter in inclement conditions than after a man-induced disaster.\nRioting is more likely after a natural disaster because of its size. Also, damage to police and military structure as well as the prolonged delay in getting assistance due to breakdown of all civil structures all predispose to rioting."

Rescue teams must only go in fully self-supporting in terms of shelter, clean water and food.\nThe most senior and experienced should go in as first responders, so that they can accurately assess what is needed, and have the authority to order things accordingly."

A brief history and swift ABC(DE) examination will give much more reliable results.\nTriage needs repeating, as the condition of patients can both deteriorate and improve over a short period of time.\nTriage is performed while quickly stabilising the sickest patients. Treatment should not delay triage but if there are obvious simple tasks to be performed, such as turning a patient into the recovery position to open his or her airway, then this should be done."

It is almost impossble to monitor a patient during helicopter flight, so, if the patient's condition cannot be stabilised slower transport might allow stops to be made to stabilise the situation when necessary.\nDrips and chest drains may be vital to the physiological stability of a patient during transfer. However, they are easily accidentally displaced so should be securely (doubly) fixed in place.\nStaff capable of monitoring the patient's condition and taking emergency action if necessary must accompany each severely injured patient. This temporarily removes skilled staff from the disaster site, but sick patients cannot be transferred without experienced staff."

Phi toxin is a myocardial suppressant. Kappa toxin destroys connective tissue.\nIt is an obligate anaerobe so it thrives in poorly perfused tissues. Spores can take one hour to 6 weeks to germinate but usually do so in 24 hours.\nClostridium cannot germinate or thrive in the presence of oxygen, so leaving a wound open protects the tissue from developing gangrene.

            "explanation": "1. D Compartment syndrome\nCompartment syndrome is a build-up of pressure in a soft tissue compartment, which unless released quickly, will lead to its death. It can only develop where muscles are enclosed in an in-elastic fascia. The most common sites are the forearm and the lower leg, but the intrinsic muscles of the hand or foot can also be affected. It develops most commonly after a closed injury, as open injuries are able to decompress themselves. Severe or prolonged crushing of the soft tissue may be adequate to start the condition, but it develops more frequently after a fracture. Swelling of the muscles or haemorrhage into the fascial compartment leads to a rise of pressure inside that compartment. The thin-walled veins draining the compartment collapse because of the raised external pressure on their walls, and so blood fails to drain from the compartment. However, the thicker-walled arteries continue to allow blood to be pumped in. As a result, pressure continues to rise in the compartment until it is the same as in the arteries pumping blood in (mean arterial pressure). Blood flow into the compartment then stops, although blood will continue to flow through the compartment to the limb beyond the compartment (so peripheral pulses may be preserved). Compartment syndrome is diagnosed clinically by a) pain out of all proportion to the injury and b) extreme pain on passive extension of the digits distal to the compartment. Treatment is by fasciotomy of the affected compartment(s) and is a surgical emergency.\n2. A Crush syndrome\nCrush syndrome is a systemic injury, which occurs to the kidneys when tissue that has been deprived of blood supply for a long period is re-perfused and releases tissue breakdown products (myoglobin and vasoactive substances) into the circulation. Myoglobin blocks the kidneys, while vasoactive substances cause fluid sequestration. Both cause renal failure. Patients who are trapped should have intravenous fluids started at high volume (1–1.5 L/ hour) even before they are released, and their urine output monitored to sustain a diuresis. It is equally important to try to avoid the release of the damaging molecules. Limbs that are clearly dead should be amputated rather than being allowed to reperfuse. Fasciotomy for compartment syndrome should not be undertaken when the compartment is obviously dead, because it will do more harm than good.\n3. E Frostbite\nFrostbite is the death of tissue which has been frozen. Normally this occurs in the extremities – toes, fingers, nose and ears. Initially the affected structure appears white and is wooden-hard to pressure. The patient and affected part should be warmed gently (to prevent heat damage) and pain relief given. Over the following days, some of the apparently dead tissue will recover while the worst affected parts will progress to dry gangrene. Provided infection does not set in, the demarcation between dead and viable tissue should be allowed to define itself without surgical interference. Only once clear and immovable demarcation has occurred should the dead tissue be excised.\n4. F Gas gangrene\nGas gangrene is infection of a wound with one of the Clostridium bacteria, usually C. perfringens. The spores are everywhere, including in the human bowel, but can only germinate and thrive in anaerobic conditions. Gangrene is therefore found in contaminated wounds, which have not been laid open and cleaned as quickly as possible (debridement), and especially in wounds which are closed when there is dead or contaminated tissue inside. The bacteria produces toxins which kill tissue and so provides an environment for its own spread. It is susceptible to Penicillin, but the antibiotic cannot penetrate dead tissue. Hyperbaric oxygen may also help, but it too cannot penetrate dead tissue. Early high amputation might be the only way to save the patient.\n5. C Hypothermia\nHypothermia is a decrease in body temperature below normal levels. Mild hypothermia down to 35 degrees is accompanied by shivering, but below that the patient stops shivering and becomes increasingly confused. Their periphery will be shut down and they may be bradycardic. Below 28 degrees cardiac arrhythmias may occur, and below 20 degrees cardiac arrest is likely. Hypothermia can be highly protective and so hypoxia or anoxia can be tolerated for longer periods than in a normal patient. Core temperature is difficult to measure and requires a special low-reading rectal thermometer. Rewarming should not be done too fast. A variety of methods are available, depending on facilities. These vary from blankets and buddy warming, through warm drinks (if they can swallow safely), humidified warmed oxygen, warm IV fluids and even peritoneal dialysis with warm dialysate.\n6. G Necrotising fasciitis\nNecrotising fasciitis is a rapidly spreading infection of fascial planes caused by a mixture of organisms, usually including ẞ-haemolytic Streptococci. Staphylococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas and Clostridium, amongst others, can also be involved. It can produce skip lesions, spreads very rapidly and has a very high mortality of well over 50%. The cornerstone of management is aggressive surgical excision, but high doses of appropriate antibiotics will be necessary as well as respiratory and circulatory support if severe. So, the patient may need endotracheal intubation and nursing in an intensive care unit during the acute phase.\n7. B Tetanus\nTetanus or lockjaw is caused by Clostridium tetani, a Gram-positive coccus whose spores are found especially in manure-contaminated soil (farmyards) but can be found everywhere else too, including the human bowel. It thrives in a wound where there is anaerobic tissue and releases a toxin, tetanospasmin, which blocks the motor inhibition pathways to sensory stimuli. The first muscles affected are in the face and larynx, causing lockjaw and risus sardonicus (facial spasms producing what could be mistaken for a smile). It is perfectly possible to protect children from this condition by inoculation with tetanus toxoid. This needs repeating every 10 years. But in cases of heavily contaminated wounds, it is probably best to give immunoglobulin as well as appropriate prophylactic antibiotics. Of course, proper wound debridement with delayed primary closure is always required. Full-blown cases will need nursing away from any stimuli (to reduce spasms) and might require paralysis and ventilatory support."
