            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with features of Paget bone disease (also known as osteitis deformans). Paget disease is a disorder of bone remodelling, characterized by excessive bone reabsorption by osteoclasis, followed by a compensatory increase in bone formation by osteoblasts. This new bone, however, is structurally weaker and more vascular than normal bone, leading to deformity, increased susceptibility to fractures and high out-put cardiac failure. It most commonly affects people from the age of 50 upwards and is more common in males. Paget disease most commonly affects the skull, spine, pelvis and legs. The alkaline phosphatase is always raised. Calcium, phosphate, alanine transferase and parathyroid levels are normal, except in the setting of prolonged immobility, where hyper-calcaemia may ensue. Characteristic appearances are found on X-ray; the bone cortex appears spongy, there is marked coarsening of the trabeculae and the whole bone is thickened. Treatment is largely with bisphospho-nates, which inhibit bone reabsorption. Complications of Paget disease include pathological fractures, compression of cranial nerves within an enlarging skull, and the development of osteosarcomas.\nSir James Paget, English surgeon (1814–1899)."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with the symptoms and signs of oesophageal achalasia, a condition where there is failure of relaxation of the lower end of the oesophagus, due to a loss of ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus. It is generally a primary disorder but can also occur secondary to malignancy and Chagas disease. It typically presents between the ages of 20 and 40 years with an equal incidence in males and females. Surgical treatment involves incising the outer muscle layers of the lower oesophagus to the upper end of the stomach (Heller myotomy) often in combination with fundoplication of the stomach to prevent reflux. Medical treatments include calcium chan-nel blockers (nifedipine) and the injection of botulinum toxin.\nRamstedt pyloromyotomy is a similar procedure performed for pyloric stenosis. Whipple procedure is used in resecting pancreatic carcinomas. Billroth I is a partial gastrectomy and Billroth II is partial gastrectomy with anastomosis of the stomach to the jejunum. These procedures have been used in the treatment of gastric ulcers and malignancies.\nErnst Heller, German surgeon (1877–1964)."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The blood supply to the femoral head is three-fold: through the retinacu-lar vessels at the base of the femoral neck (outside the capsule of the hip joint), through the intramedullary vessels, and through the ligamentum teres (which in the adult is usually negligible). Fractures can interrupt the blood supply, and a fracture that occurs within the joint capsule (intracapsular) disrupts the blood supply through both the retinacular and medullary vessels. An extracapsular fracture only disrupts the med-ullary blood supply. As a result, intracapsular femoral neck fractures carry a high risk of avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The treat-ment of such displaced fractures depends on the age of the patient. In older patients (over the age of 65) the femoral head would be removed and replaced with a prosthesis, either in the form of a hemiarthroplasty or a total hip replacement (depending on the fitness of the individual). In the younger patient, much is done to try to preserve the femoral head, and therefore a fracture in such a case would be reduced and fixed. One option is the use of cannulated screws, which are also used in treating undisplaced intracapsular fractures in the elderly. A fractured neck of femur in the young is considered an orthopaedic emergency, as delay in treatment increases the likelihood of developing avascular necrosis. Dynamic hip screws are used in treating extracapsular femoral neck fractures."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The femoral nerve enters the thigh via the femoral triangle, where it lies lateral to the femoral artery. It can easily be damaged by penetrat-ing wounds, hip dislocations or thigh haematomas. The femoral nerve supplies motor branches to the quadriceps, and sensory branches to the anterior thigh and medial calf (via the saphenous nerve). Femoral nerve palsies result in a loss of knee extension and loss of sensation over the anterior thigh and medial leg.\nFemoral, from Latin femur = thigh."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "A local anaesthetic is a drug which reversibly inhibits the propagation of nerve impulses. It acts by transiently altering the neurone membrane permeability to sodium ions.\nBefore suturing a finger, anaesthesia is produced by doing a ring block. This involves injection of 1-2 mL of local anaesthetic either side of the proximal phalanx at the level of the web space where the digital nerves run, producing anaesthesia along the entire length of the digit. Lidocaine is a quick-acting local anaesthetic and is appropriate for ring blocks. Adrenaline causes vasoconstriction and has the advantages of slowing systemic absorption and prolonging duration of action of local anaesthet-ics. However, local anaesthetics containing adrenaline must never be used near end arteries (e.g. digits, nose and penis) as there is a risk of ischaemic necrosis.\nThe maximum dose of lidocaine is 3 mg/kg (or 7 mg/kg if given with adrenaline).\nLidocaine/prilocaine mixture can be given as a topical emulsion prep-aration to children before inserting a cannula or taking bloods. It is marketed under the trade name EMLA (eutetic mixture of local anaes-thetic) and the emulsion is left on for 30–60 minutes to allow full dermal anaesthesia to take place. A 'eutetic' mixture is one that contains equal amounts of each ingredient. For example, EMLA contains 2.5% each of lidocaine and prilocaine. Other examples of topical local anaesthet-ics include Instillagel™ (lidocaine) used for urethral catheterization, and Xylocaine™ (lidocaine) spray given before upper gastrointestinal endos-copies. Amethocaine eye drops are used for conjunctival anaesthesia. Amethocaine is also available as a cream (Amitop™) and its onset of action of dermal anaesthesia is more rapid than EMLA.\nCocaine was the first compound to be used as a local anaesthetic. Its anaesthetic properties were discovered accidentally by Sigmund Freud (Austrian neurologist, psychiatrist and frequent cocaine user). Cocaine has since been used in ophthalmic and nasal operations. Side effects of cocaine include intense vasoconstriction and cardiotoxicity, so it has now largely been replaced by benzocaine and proxymetacaine for ENT use."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with the symptoms of diverticular disease. Diverticula are caused by high intraluminal pressures within the colon, usually secondary to constipation, leading to the herniation of mucosa through weak points in the bowel wall (these being at the site of entry of blood vessels). Barium enema is a radiological technique in which con-trast is used to assess the anatomy of the rectum and colon, and can be used to confirm the presence of diverticula (seen as outpouchings of con-trast). An apple-core lesion is an annular constriction of the colon typical of colonic cancer. Barium enemas have in the past been used to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis as an inflamed appendix that does not fill with barium. Thumb printing of the colon is seen in attacks of ischaemic colitis and represents areas of mucosal and submucosal haemorrhage and oedema."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Gastric cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide and is most common in the Japanese, Chinese and Russian populations. Its peak incidence is between the ages of 50 and 70, and men are more com-monly affected than women. Presenting symptoms may be quite vague in the early stages and include epigastric pain, early satiety, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. As a result, gastric cancers are often diag-nosed late and have a poor prognosis (5-year survival of around 20%). The majority (95%) of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, and eating pickled and smoked foods. Patients with a history of chronic peptic ulceration, per-nicious anaemia, Menetrier disease, and those who have had a previous gastrectomy are at greater risk of developing gastric carcinoma. External manifestations of metastasis include left-sided supraclavicular lymph-adenopathy (Virchow node) and umbilical lumps (Sister Joseph's nod-ules). Transcoelomic spread of gastric cancer to the ovaries is known as Krukenberg tumours.\nPernicious anaemia is a megaloblastic anaemia caused by autoantibod-ies to gastric parietal cells, resulting in impaired absorption of vitamin B12 secondary to a lack of intrinsic factor. Damage to parietal cells results in anaemia and atrophic gastritis, secondary to achlorhydria. Menetrier disease is a rare condition usually affecting young to mid-dle-aged men. It is characterized by hyperplasia of mucus-producing cells within the stomach resulting in reduced acid secretion and a protein-losing enteropathy. Symptoms include epigastric pain, weight loss and peripheral oedema secondary to hypoalbuminaemia. There is a 10% risk of gastric carcinoma, so regular endoscopic surveillance is warranted.\nRudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow, German pathologist (1821–1901).\nFriedrich Ernst Krukenberg, German gynaecologist (1871–1946)."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "A pseudobulbar palsy is the result of a bilateral upper motor neurone lesion affecting the 9th to 12th cranial nerves inclusively. The lesion arises within the corticobulbar pathways or pyramidal tract. Causes include motor neurone disease, multiple sclerosis and brain stem tumours. Other signs include those of an upper motor neurone lesion in the limbs (spas-ticity, hyperreflexia, weakness without muscle wasting). By contrast, a bulbar palsy is caused by a bilateral lower motor neurone lesion of the 9th to 12th cranial nerves inclusively. It may also present with dysphagia and dysarthria. Other features include a wasted fasciculating tongue, drool-ing and an absent gag reflex. General features of a lower motor neurone lesion include hypotonicity, hyporeflexia and muscular fasciculations. The lesion in bulbar palsy may arise within the medulla, or from outside the brain stem. Causes include motor neurone disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome and myasthenia gravis.\nScleroderma is a chronic autoimmune condition of unknown cause, characterized by thickening of the skin and other organs. The condition may be localized, or diffuse (systemic sclerosis). Characteristic features are described by the CREST syndrome (Calcinosis, Raynaud's, oEsopha-geal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasia). Paralysis of the vocal cords presents with hoarseness of the voice and dysphagia with regurgita-tion. Causes include neurological conditions, e.g. following cerebrovas-cular accident, tumours and tetanus. Bilateral vocal cord paralysis would result in respiratory distress and arrest. The vocal cords can be visualized and assessed by laryngoscopy."

It is a severe, decompensated form of hypothyroidism with a marked reduction in free thyroxine. Myxoedema coma is four times more common in women and its incidence increases after the age of 50. Myxoedema coma is more common in those with undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism and following thyroid surgery. It may also be precipitated by cold, infections, trauma and drugs such as amiodarone. Physical findings are those of severe hypothyroidism, namely hypothermia, hypotensive shock, non-pitting oedema, lethargy and reduced consciousness. Treatment must be aggressive and take place in an intensive care setting. Intravenous thyroxine is necessary, as is the rapid and adequate administration of treatment such as gentle re-warm-ing and treatment of associated problems such as infection and hypona-traemia. Intubation and mechanical ventilation and cardiac monitoring may also be required.\nBoth propranolol and propylthiouracil are used in the treatment of a thyroid storm a life-threatening emergency caused by excessive thyroid hormones. It presents with clinically opposite features including hyper-thermia, hypertension, tachycardia, weight loss and altered behaviour. Treatment in both cases must not be delayed until blood results are avail-able and should be based initially on clinical findings due to the high mortality."

            "explanation": "Hepatitis is the name given to inflammation of the liver, regardless of the aetiology. Causes include infections (viral hepatitis), drugs (e.g. iso-niazid), alcohol, abnormal metabolism (haemochromatosis) and auto-immune conditions. Hepatic damage caused by alcohol occurs in three stages: the first is the development of a fatty liver (reversible); the sec-ond an alcohol-induced hepatitis (partially reversible); and the third is cirrhosis - end-stage, irreversible liver damage. Symptoms of alcoholic liver disease may be very vague in the initial stages, including nausea and right upper quadrant pain. Jaundice, encephalopathy, ascites and caput medusa (dilated peri-umbilical veins) are signs of late irreversible disease. Around 10% of those with cirrhosis develop hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcohol-induced cirrhosis may be an indication for a liver transplant.\nHepatitis A is caused by an RNA virus which is spread by the faeco-oral route and is the most common cause of hepatitis worldwide. It is an acute condition causing gastrointestinal disturbance and jaundice. Treatment is supportive and the condition is largely self-limiting. Hepatitis B is a DNA virus that is spread by inoculation of bodily fluids. It causes an acute hepatitis which may become a chronic condition in some and result in liver cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a condition of unknown cause. It is rare and most commonly affects young to middle-aged women. It is associated with other autoimmune conditions. Treatment is with immu-nosuppressants but the disease can progress to cirrhosis. Reye syndrome is characterized by encephalopathy and the presence of a fatty liver. It is associated with aspirin use in children."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient has presented with symptoms of hypoglycaemia, caused by an insulinoma. An insulinoma is a neuroendocrine tumour of the pan-creatic beta cells resulting in autonomic insulin production leading to symptomatic hypoglycaemia. Insulinomas are characterized by Whipple's triad: episodic hypoglycaemia + central nervous system dysfunction (anxiety, confusion) + symptomatic relief by the administration of glu-cose. Blood results will show reduced blood glucose levels, elevated insu-lin levels (despite hypoglycaemia), elevated pro-insulin levels and elevated C-peptide levels. C-peptide is the by product of the cleavage of pro-insulin into insulin and can be used to differentiate cases of factitious hyperin-sulinaemia, as in exogenous insulin administration, where C-peptide lev-els will not be elevated. Insulinomas are largely benign (90%) and may be part of the MEN I syndrome. Treatment is by excision of the tumour. Insulinomas are the most common type of pancreatic endocrine tumours. Glucagon increases blood glucose and somatostatin inhibits insulin pro-duction, therefore glucagonomas and somatostatinomas present with the features of hyperglycaemia."

            "explanation": "This child presented with signs of large bowel obstruction, as indicated by the failure of meconium passage. The most common cause for obstruction in the neonatal period is Hirschsprung disease a congenital absence of ganglion cells from the myenteric plexus of the large bowel, resulting in a narrowed, contracted segment. The abnormally innervated bowel extends proximally from the rectum for a variable distance. Ten percent of cases affect the whole colon. It occurs in approximately 1/5000 births and is three times more common in males. Hirschsprung disease often presents in neonates with abdominal distension and bile-stained vomiting. Rectal examination shows a narrowed segment, and removal of the examining finger is often followed by a gush of stools and flatus. Less severe cases can present in later life with chronic constipation, abdominal distension, megacolon and occasionally offensive overflow diarrhoea. A definitive diagnosis is made by rectal biopsy which shows absent ganglion cells in the submucosa, with an increase in acetylcholinesterase cells in the muscula-ris mucosae. A barium enema will confirm the presence of a contracted rectum. Abdominal X-ray will confirm the diagnosis of obstruction but not the cause. Rectal examination may relieve obstruction temporarily by allowing the passage of meconium. Treatment of Hirschsprung disease involves an initial defunctioning colostomy to relieve the obstruction, fol-lowed by either excision or bypass of the affected segment of bowel.\nHarald Hirschsprung, Danish paediatrician (1830–1916)."

The typical symp-toms of bowel obstruction are abdominal pain, distension, vomiting and absolute constipation (not passing faeces or wind). The clinical picture is dependent upon the site of obstruction: small bowel obstruction presents initially with central colicky abdominal pain, distension and vomiting; large bowel obstruction presents with lower abdominal pain, distension and constipation. Vomiting is usually a late sign in large bowel obstruction and tends to be faeculent. Obstruction may be mechanical or functional, where there is a reduction in normal peristaltic activity of the bowel. The most common causes of small bowel obstruction are adhesions and her-nias. Common causes of large bowel obstruction are faecal impaction, hernias and tumours. Paralytic ileus commonly follows gastrointestinal surgery where there is excessive handling of bowel, and can be caused by electrolyte disturbances. Gallstones can cause obstruction if they erode through the gallbladder and into the duodenum, subsequently lodging distally at the ileocaecal junction (gallstone ileus). Abdominal X-ray may show air in the biliary tree or a stone at the ileocaecal junction, together with small bowel obstruction."

A patient who is fully alert and talking is maintaining the airway and therefore sup-plemental oxygen via face mask is all that is required. With impaired consciousness, an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway would be required as assistance, depending on which is the better tolerated. A more conscious patient would not be able to tolerate an oropharyngeal airway. Any patient who is unconscious, and therefore unable to protect their airway, needs a definitive airway, i.e. endotracheal intubation. The jaw thrust can be performed in the immobilized patient to assist in open-ing the airway, but never hyperextend the neck as this can damage the cervical spine. There are certain situations where intubation may be con-sidered early, such as in smoke inhalation or those at risk of respiratory arrest. There may be situations in which endotracheal intubation is not possible due to complete occlusion of the upper airway, e.g. severe facial injuries. In this situation, a needle cricothyroidotomy provides a tempo-rary means of ventilation until a formal tracheostomy can be performed in theatre."

A saphena varix often has a bluish tinge, is soft and compressible, disappears on lying down, has a cough impulse and exhibits a fluid thrill when the long saphenous vein is tapped distally (Schwartz test). It is often associated with varicosities elsewhere in the saphenous system.\nA psoas abscess is a recognized complication of tuberculosis following the development of a paraspinal abscess (Pott's disease). If this abscess tracks down the psoas muscle towards the groin, an inguinal psoas abscess can arise.

An ectopic pregnancy is one that implants outside the uterus, most commonly in the fallopian tubes. It occurs in up to 1% of pregnancies and is associated with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, intra-uterine contraceptive devices, progesterone-only pills, previous tubal surgery and previous ectopic pregnancy.\nEctopic pregnancy can present with amenorrhoea, abnormal vaginal spotting or bleeding, or vague abdominal pain. Rupture of an ectopic pregnancy causes acute abdominal pain. Clinically there may be local-ized guarding or generalized peritonitis with a rigid abdomen. Blood loss results in shock. Urgent resuscitation is required in these cases with either laparotomy or laparoscopy to remove the ectopic pregnancy. In early pregnancy, abdominal ultrasound may not be sensitive enough to detect the conceptus; a transvaginal scan is more sensitive. If the diagnosis is in doubt, serial measurements of serum beta-hCG can be performed. In nor-mal pregnancies this will double every 2 days, but in an ectopic pregnancy the doubling time will be prolonged.\nEctopic, from Greek ek = away from + topos = place, i.e. in the wrong place."

            "explanation": "Osteochondritis dissecans is characterized by local ischaemic necrosis of a segment of the articular surface of a bone and its overlying cartilage. There is eventual separation of the fragment which results in an intra-articular loose body. The knee is the most common site for osteochondritis dis-secans, especially the medial condyle of the femur. If the intra-articular loose body becomes trapped in the joint, the patient experiences sudden 'locking' of the knee associated with severe pain and swelling (as in this scenario). Loose bodies in the knee can often be seen by radiography and are usually found in the suprapatellar pouch (they are occasionally palpa-ble here). Management is by removal of the loose body using arthroscopy.\nIn chondromalacia patellae the cartilage of the articular surface of the patella becomes roughened. The pain is caused by friction between the damaged area and the femoral condyle. Chondromalacia patellae presents in teenage girls with an aching pain behind the kneecap which is exacer-bated by climbing and descending stairs. X-rays show no abnormality.\nThe pre-patellar bursa lies in front of the lower half of the patella and the upper part of the patellar tendon. Repeated friction of the bursa, usu-ally in those who kneel, results in pain and swelling of the bursa. This is known as prepatellar bursitis, or housemaid's knee. Management can either be by aspiration (although recurrence may occur) or excision of the offending bursa.\nChondromalacia, from Greek khondros = cartilage + malakos = soft.\nDissecans, from Latin dissecare = to separate."

Therefore all breast lumps must be investigated or at least referred to the breast clinic for assessment. Mammography is the first-line imaging choice in the older woman (over 40 years); however, the increased breast density in younger patients makes ultrasound investi-gation more sensitive. Most malignant breast lumps are painless, so this is not a reliable indicator of serious pathology; neither is the size of the lump.

The overall lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is around 6% and the majority of cases have no obvious identifiable risk factors. Specific risk factors include familial adenomatous polyposis, hereditary non-polypo-sis colorectal cancer, a family history and inflammatory bowel disease. The treatment of colorectal cancers is dependent on the site of the tumour.\nAbdominoperineal resections are performed when the tumour lies in the distal third of the rectum (within 8 cm of the anus). In this proce-dure, both abdominal and perineal incisions are made and the anus, rec-tum and part of the sigmoid colon removed with the remaining sigmoid colon being brought out as a permanent colostomy. Anterior resections are used in tumours of the proximal two-thirds of the rectum. Following tumour removal, an anastomosis is made between the sigmoid and the lower rectum. Right hemicolectomy is performed for non-obstructing tumours of the right side of the colon. This involves removal of the distal ileum, ascending colon and the proximal portion of the transverse colon. The right hemicolectomy may be extended if the tumour is situated in the transverse colon or at the hepatic flexure. Left hemicolectomy is used for non-obstructing tumours of the descending colon and splenic flexure."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "A hernia is the abnormal protrusion of the whole, or part, of a viscus through its containing walls. A femoral hernia is the protrusion of con-tents, i.e. extraperitoneal fat, omentum or bowel, into the potential space of the femoral canal. Femoral hernias are three times more common in women than men and more commonly occur on the right side. They are differentiated from inguinal hernias in that they lie below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. Inguinal hernias are caused by weakness in the abdominal wall at the entrance to the inguinal canal. They may be indirect (75%), passing through the internal inguinal ring and down the inguinal canal, or direct, passing through the posterior wall of the canal but not down the canal. Inguinal hernias are found above and medial to the pubic tubercle. The contents of a hernia may be returned to the abdominal cavity either spontaneously or with direct pressure, and this is described as a reducible hernia. There will be a cough impulse on examination. Hernias which cannot be returned to the abdominal cavity are described as irreducible or incarcerated. There will be no cough impulse on examination. Both reducible and incarcerated hernias are typically painless.\nA strangulated hernia is one in which the blood supply to the contents is cut off; in other words where an irreducible hernia develops oedema and venous congestion, causing pressure on the arterial supply. The area subsequently becomes ischaemic and then gangrenous. Strangulation is common in femoral hernias due to the narrow neck of the femoral canal. Obstruction of bowel within the hernia sac presents with the typical fea-tures of vomiting, colicky abdominal pain, distension and absolute con-stipation, and may be associated with strangulation of bowel. If untreated, perforation and peritonitis occur. Strangulated and obstructed hernias are surgical emergencies.\nHernia, from Greek hernias = to sprout forth."

Neurofibromas may be sin-gle or multiple, as in neurofibromatosis. Neurofibromatosis (NF) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple neurofibromas, coffee-coloured macules (café-au-lait patches) and axillary freckling with a risk of developing central nervous system tumours (acoustic neuroma, optic glioma, meningioma), iris fibromas (Lisch nodules) and phaeochro-mocytomas. There are two types of neurofibromatosis (NF): NF1 (von Recklinghausen disease) is the 'peripheral' form which displays the cuta-neous manifestations; and NF2 is the ‘central' form with bilateral central nervous systems tumours and very few cutaneous features.\nFriedrich von Recklinghausen, German pathologist (1833–1910)."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The radial nerve runs in close proximity to the shaft of the humerus in the spiral groove. Common causes of radial nerve palsies include humeral shaft fractures (as in this scenario, in which case patients also suffer bruis-ing to the upper arm), compression of the nerve in the arm with prolonged use of ill-fitting crutches and elbow dislocations or Monteggia fractures. Damage to the radial nerve is also seen in people who fall asleep with their arm hanging over the back of a chair ('Saturday night palsy'). The radial nerve supplies the extensors to the forearm and wrist, and a radial nerve palsy results in an inability to extend the wrist or metacarpophalangeal joints (wrist drop), forearm extensor wasting and a loss of sensation in the anatomical snuffbox. The anatomical snuffbox is the name given to the triangular region on the radial dorsal aspect of the hand at the level of the carpal bones. It is so called because it was the surface used since the 16th century for placing and snorting 'snuff' (powdered tobacco).\nThe posterior interosseous nerve is a branch of the radial nerve that runs deep in the forearm to supply the wrist and finger extensors except the extensor carpi radialis longus (which is innervated by a proximal branch from the radial nerve). The posterior interosseous nerve can be damaged in forearm fractures and results in an inability to extend the fingers and a weak wrist drop. The wrist drop is only slight as the extensor carpi radia-lis longus muscle still provides some wrist extension. There is no sensory loss with these nerve lesions.\nThe anterior interosseous nerve is a motor branch of the median nerve in the forearm. Lesions of this nerve are rare and usually arise from deep lacerations to the forearm. The anterior interosseous nerve provides motor fibres to flexor pollicis longus, the medial part of flexor digito-rum profundus and pronator quadratus. Patients have a weakness in the thumb and index finger characterized by a deformity in the pinch mecha-nism between the thumb and index finger."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Hearing loss may be conductive or sensorineural in origin. In conductive deafness, sound is not transmitted to the inner ear, the abnormality being in the external or middle ear. Sensorineural deafness is a result of pathol-ogy within the cochlea or the vestibulocochlear nerve and/or its trans-mission of signals to the brain. Conductive and sensorineural deafness may be differentiated by using a tuning fork. The examining doctor in this scenario has performed the Rinne test. In this investigation a vibrat-ing tuning fork of 512 Hz (an octave above 'middle C') is placed initially on the mastoid process (bone conduction), and then next to the ear (air conduction). The patient is then asked which sound was loudest. In the normal ear, air conduction (AC) is better than bone conduction (BC) – this is known as a positive Rinne test. In the woman in this scenario, AC is better than BC – this positive Rinne test with left-sided deafness is associ-ated with a sensorineural hearing loss. The second clinical test often used when examining hearing is the Weber test. In this test a vibrating 512 Hz tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead. The patient is asked to report in which ear the sound is loudest. In conductive deafness, the sound is heard louder in the deafer ear. In sensorineural deafness the sound is heard louder in the better ear.\nAn acoustic neuroma is a benign tumour of the Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve, more predominant in women between the fourth and seventh decade. Its cause is unknown but it develops bilaterally in those with type 2 neurofibromatosis. Features of an acoustic neuroma include hearing loss, tinnitus, imbalance, facial sensory disturbance (due to the close proximity to the trigeminal nerve) and weakness of the facial muscles on the affected side (facial nerve compression). Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure (headache, visual loss) occur if the neu-roma is large. Acoustic neuromas are best seen on MRI. Treatment may be observation (if the neuroma is small) or surgical removal.\nOtosclerosis is a conductive form of deafness caused by the overgrowth and sclerosis of the temporal bone resulting in a 'fixed' stapes. It is a pro-gressive condition seen most commonly in Caucasian females, and goes on to affect both ears. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, but has variable penetrance. A common symptom is paracusis (hearing is better when there is background noise). Symptoms are aggravated by pregnancy. Treatment is by stapedectomy and stapes implant. Presbycusis is the name given to age related deafness. It is sensorineural in origin, caused by the degeneration of the nerve cells within the inner ear. It is the most common form of deafness with progressive age and is bilateral. The onset of presbycusis may be hastened by certain drugs (e.g. aspirin) and repetitive noise trauma.\nMénières disease is a condition of unknown aetiology affecting the lab-yrinth of the inner ear. Symptoms are usually intermittent and include vertigo, tinnitus and difficulty hearing low frequency sounds. There is an association with viral infections. Treatment is largely symptomatic and includes antihistamines and prochlorperazine. A perforated eardrum can occur following trauma, infection and sudden loud noises. The level of deafness is dependent on the size of the perforation, which usually heals itself within 8 weeks. Rarely a tympanoplasty may be required.\nOtosclerosis, from Greek oto = ear+ skleros = hard; 'hardening of the ear'. Acoustic, from Greek akoustikos = to hear.

            "explanation": "This patient has presented with acute renal failure secondary to urinary tract obstruction by a renal calculus. This is a urological emergency and must be managed immediately to prevent irreversible damage to the kid-neys. A percutaneous nephrostomy, which is the insertion of a catheter into the renal pelvis through the skin, creates a temporary diversion of urine, reducing the back-pressure on the kidney and giving time for for-mal removal of the stone. Percutaneous nephrostomies are performed under radiological guidance and local anaesthesia. Other indications for percutaneous nephrostomy include the diversion of urine following dam-age to the ureters, obstruction secondary to pregnancy, and to allow the drainage of a perinephric abscess. Insertion is contraindicated in those with a bleeding diathesis. Complications of percutaneous nephrostomy include haemorrhage, sepsis and damage to surrounding organs (e.g. pneumothorax).\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy uses sound waves, which pen-etrate the skin, to break large renal calculi into smaller fragments that can be passed more easily by the patient. It can be performed easily as an outpatient procedure, under local anaesthesia. Percutaneous neph-rolithotomy allows the removal of stones from the upper ureter and kidney without having to perform an open procedure. A guide wire is inserted under radiological guidance and a tract is made through which the stone can be removed. Ureteroscopy is a procedure in which a fine bore endoscope is inserted into the ureter via the urethra. It is performed under general or epidural anaesthesia. Indications include removal of ureteric stones, insertion of a ureteric stent and dilatation of strictures. Nephrectomy is the surgical removal of the kidney. It may be done as an open or laparoscopic procedure. Indications for nephrectomy include localized renal cell carcinoma and an irreversibly malfunctioning kidney."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "The spleen is the most vascular organ in the body, containing up to one unit of blood at any time. Splenic injuries are therefore potentially life threatening. The spleen is the most commonly injured organ in cases of thoraco-abdominal trauma, particularly with blunt injuries. It is com-monly associated with lower left-sided rib fractures. The presentation of splenic trauma depends on the extent of damage and may vary from vague upper left-sided abdominal pain (in cases of a subcapsular haema-toma) to shock and peritonitis with splenic rupture. Up to 50% of patients with a ruptured spleen have other intraperitoneal injuries. The manage-ment of splenic trauma depends upon the stability of the patient. Unstable patients require resuscitation and transfer to theatre. The most suitable imaging technique in the stable patient would be a CT scan which would not only confirm the diagnosis but assess the severity of damage. The triad of an elevated left hemidiaphragm, left lower lobe atelectasis and pleural effusion in splenic rupture is rarely seen on chest X-ray; however any patient with hemidiaphragm elevation should be considered to have a splenic injury unless otherwise proved.\nSplenic injuries may be graded as follows:\n1. Minor subcapsular tear or haematoma\n2. Parenchymal injury not extending to the hilum\n3. Parenchymal injury involving the hilum and vessels\n4. Shattered spleen\nGrade 1 and 2 splenic injuries may be treated conservatively on a watch and wait basis. Grade 3 injuries are treated with splenic repair and grade 4 injuries with splenectomy. Asplenic patients are at risk of thrombo-sis and serious infections by encapsulated bacteria (Pneumococcus and Meningococcus). Lifelong prophylaxis with penicillin is therefore required.\nRupture of the diaphragm is usually the result of blunt abdominal trauma and commonly occurs with splenic injury. The majority of dia-phragmatic ruptures occur on the left (due to the protection by the liver on the right) and posteriorly (a congenitally weaker area). Large lacera-tions result in the herniation of abdominal contents into the thorax caus-ing respiratory distress. On examination there will be reduced air entry on the affected side and paradoxical movement of the abdomen. Bowel sounds may be heard in the chest. Treatment is by surgical repair."

Patients present with a rapidly growing mass, and there may be features of infiltration, e.g. facial nerve involvement and regional palpable lymph nodes. Treatment involves parotidectomy with radiotherapy. Prognosis is poor.\nA pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumour of the salivary glands, more commonly affecting the parotid gland. The name arises from the typical variable appearance of the tumours with light microscopy. Presentation is with a slow growing, firm, painless mass. Treatment is by surgical resec-tion. Salivary tumours should be investigated with imaging and biopsy to determine whether they are malignant or benign. Salivary gland calculi are calcium stones that cause obstruction of the salivary ducts leading to intense pain and swelling of the affected gland while eating. The symp-toms resolve within an hour or two. The submandibular gland duct (of Wharton) is the most common site. Diagnosis is by injecting a dye into the duct system (sialography), and treatment is by removing the stone. Acute bacterial sialothiasis is the result of superimposed bacterial infec-tion within an obstructed salivary duct causing acute inflammation, pain and abscess formation. Intravenous antibiotics are required. Mumps is caused by a RNA paramyxovirus and causes painful enlargement of the salivary glands. It typically affects the parotid gland (parotitis), is largely bilateral and most commonly affects children. Treatment is symptomatic."

The term encom-passes both cancers of the colon (60%) and rectum (40%), although in up to 5% of patients multiple sites are affected. The majority of these can-cers are adenocarcinomas. Risk factors include increasing age, a diet high in red meats, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, previous history of bowel cancer and genetic conditions such as familial adenomatous polyp-osis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Common presenting complaints include a change in bowel habit, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. Symptoms often vary in nature accord-ing to the site of the tumour: right-sided lesions usually present with iron deficiency anaemia (from chronic blood loss) and a palpable mass, while left-sided lesions present with pain, rectal bleeding and a change in bowel habit.

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Slipped upper femoral epiphysis is a consequence of instability of the proximal femoral growth plate, resulting in the postero-lateral displace-ment of the femoral head in relation to the femur. It is a rare but impor-tant cause of hip pain in adolescents. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis commonly presents between the ages of 10 and 15, with boys and the left hip most commonly affected. The condition is bilateral in at least 20% of cases. Associations include hypothyroidism, Frohlich adiposogenital syn-drome (characterized by obesity and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism) and a tall stature. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis may present acutely after minimal trauma or have a more insidious presentation. Symptoms include hip, groin and knee pain, a limp, and an externally rotated and shortened leg. Acute cases may present with an inability to weight bear. The diagnosis may be made on X-ray (AP and lateral 'frog's leg' view), which may show widening of the growth plate and displacement of the femoral head. The management of slipped upper femoral epiphy-sis is bed rest (to prevent further slippage) and analgesia, until ortho-paedic assessment is carried out. The management is then by surgical closure of the epiphysis (usually performed as a closed procedure with cannulated screws). The contralateral hip may be fixed at the same time. Complications include avascular necrosis of the femoral head (secondary to attempts at reduction), coxa vara (caused by fusion in the slipped posi-tion), chondrolysis (destruction of articular cartilage), premature epiphy-seal fusion and secondary osteoarthritis.\nSpontaneous haemarthrosis is an acute spontaneous bleed into a joint without a history of trauma. The knee is most commonly affected. Spontaneous haemarthrosis is most commonly seen with haemo-philia. Recurrent haemarthroses result in damage to the joint and early osteoarthritis."

Causes include central disc prolapse, trauma and metastatic disease. The diagnosis and cause can be confirmed on MRI (and less sensitively by CT and myelography); however, to pre-vent irreversible nerve damage, review by the specialist team must not be delayed in waiting for further investigation. Transfer of the patient to a specialist centre would be more appropriate. The mainstay of treatment is surgical decompression.\nCauda equina, from Latin cauda = tail + equus = horse."

Atonic bladder may occur after spinal injuries and lower motor neurone disease. Detrusor instability is the spontaneous contraction of the bladder dur-ing filling and results in urge incontinence. Benign prostatic hyperplasia can cause overflow incontinence secondary to bladder outflow obstruc-tion but the patient will have the sensation of a full bladder or incomplete emptying. Urinary tract infections and bladder calculi are associated with irritative bladder symptoms such as frequency, urgency and dysuria."

Incisional hernias are generally asymptomatic but may develop the same complications as other types of hernia, i.e. strangulation and obstruc-tion. This patient is asymptomatic and therefore emergency surgery is not indicated. In view of her obesity and COPD, which would predispose to hernia recurrence, it would be safer to manage her conservatively unless circumstances change."

Magnetic resonance angiogram is a fast, non-operator-dependent inves-tigation, but has associated risks of contrast use.

The incidence of AAA is up to 5% in the over 60s and rupture accounts for around 2% of causes of death in men (AAA are less common in women and develop much later). The overall mortality associ-ated with AAA is at least 60% (up to half die before they reach hospital) and is rising. The majority of AAAs are diagnosed incidentally. The clas-sic presentation of a ruptured AAA is acute abdominal pain with hypo-tension and a pulsatile mass in the abdomen. The patient is often pale and sweaty, the mass may be tender, and an overlying bruit may be heard. Other presentations include back and flank pain (secondary to retroperi-toneal haemorrhage – may be mistaken for renal colic) and circulatory collapse/cardiac arrest.\nThe investigation of a patient with a suspected AAA depends upon their stability. Insert two wide bore cannulae, take all routine bloods (includ-ing a cross match sample for 6 units) and start fluid resuscitation. Stable patients without evidence of haemodynamic instability are suitable for imaging, which may include abdominal X-ray (AAA is seen to be calcified in 75%), ultrasound examination (only useful if a diagnosis of AAA is not previously known) and CT (gives the most information). If the patient is unstable, an emergency operation is indicated, even if the patient is not adequately resuscitated. Operative mortality is 40% at 1 month. The main causes of post-operative death are renal and cardiac failure."

It has an association with manual labour, anti-epileptic medications (phenobarbitone, phenytoin), alcoholic liver disease, diabetes and hypothyroidism. Other areas of the body may also be affected such as the soles of the feet (Ledderhose disease) and the penis (Peyronie disease). In the early stages management is largely conserva-tive but if function is affected then surgery is indicated. Surgery involves excising the thickened aponeurosis and would be followed by a period of splinting and physiotherapy to restore hand function.

Primary myxoedema is also known as spon-taneous atrophic hypothyroidism. It is characterized by an idiopathic reduction in the production of thyroid hormones. Features of hypothy-roidism include a hoarse voice, constipation, feeling cold, weight gain, low mood, lethargy, coarse hair and dysmenorrhoea. The diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is made by demonstrating a low T4 (thyroxine) despite a high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Hypothyroidism is treated with daily thyroxine, which is taken for life.\nOlder patients with undiagnosed hypothyroidism, or those who do not take their medications, can present with features of severe hypothyroid-ism or a myxoedema coma. These include impaired consciousness, hypo-thermia, bradycardia and hypoglycaemia. Patients with a myxoedema coma should be transferred to intensive care for fluids, gentle re-warming and intravenous thyroid hormones. The mortality is 50%.\nHaemorrhage into a thyroid cyst presents with acute neck pain and swelling. Haemorrhage can result in tracheal compression and stridor. If possible, aspiration of the cyst contents should be performed to alleviate tracheal compression and maintain airway patency.

Around 10% of cases of Wilms tumour are bilateral. It is associated with a deletion on the short arm of chromosome 11 and may be linked with other congeni-tal anomalies such as aniridia (incomplete formation of the iris) and polycystic kidney disease. Presentation is usually vague (features include weight loss, anorexia and fever) and the abdominal mass is often found incidentally on examination. Diagnosis can be confirmed on ultrasound and CT. Nephrectomy and radiotherapy is the main-stay of treatment of localized disease, with chemotherapy in advanced disease. Nephroblastomas are pale grey with areas of haemorrhage on cross-section.\nNeuroblastomas are tumours of the neural crest and most commonly occur in the adrenal medulla.
