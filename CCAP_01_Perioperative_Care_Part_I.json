He has no history of similar episodes and no reported previous heat-related injury. He has no history of sickle cell disease. He is awake, conversant, and oriented with normal vital signs. Other than severe discomfort in his calves and thighs, his physical examination is negative. Laboratory studies demonstrate the following:\\nSerum\\nNa+ = 147 mEq/L (136-145 mEq/L)\\nK+ = 2.8 mEq/L (3.5 5.0 mEq/L)\\nCr 101 mEq/L (95-105 mEq/L)\\nCO2 = 28 mEq/L (23 29 mEq/L)\\nBUN = 17 mg/dL (7-20 mEq/L)\\nGlucose = 80 mg/dL (70-100 mEq/L)\\nCreatinine = 1.1 mg/dL (0.4-1.3 mEq/L)\\nSerum Ca++ = 8.2 mEq/L (8.5-10.2 mEq/L)\\nCreatine phosphokinase = 400 U/L (60-174 U/L)\\nMg++ = 2 mg/dL (1.5-2.5 mEq/L)\\nUrine\\nColor: dark yellow\\npH: 5.7\\nSpecific gravity: 1.038\\nDip Stick\\nBlood: trace\\nGlucose: negative\\nProtein: trace\\nMicroscopic: crystals present, few white blood cells, no red blood cells or casts\\nInitial treatment should consist of intravenous fluids containing",

            "explanation": "- Approximately one-third of women with melanoma are of childbearing age, making it the most common malignancy during pregnancy.\\n- Traditionally, pregnancy-associated melanoma (PAM) was thought to have a worse prognosis, but recent studies show no significant differences in stage, recurrence rates, or survival rates between PAM and non-PAM patients.\\n- Survival in PAM patients depends on the same factors as non-PAM patients (Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration, sentinel node status).\\n- PAM patients should be treated expeditiously with wide excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy, similar to non-PAM patients.\\n- All 15 PAM patients in a recent review undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy had general anesthesia.\\n- 99mTc sulfur colloid is safe for the fetus if the dose is kept below 50 mGy, and lymphoscintigraphy delivers less than 5 mGy.\\n- Blue dye is often not used due to potential teratogenic and anaphylactic risks.\\n- Preoperative CT scanning is not indicated for this patient's clinical stage (T2aN0, IB melanoma) regardless of pregnancy; scans should be done postoperatively if upstaging occurs."

A normal anion gap is 6-12 mEq/L, so 24 indicates a high anion gap.\\n- The base excess is -4.8 mEq/L, indicating a deficit of base.\\n- These values strongly indicate a metabolic acidosis.\\n- The explanation further states that the metabolic acidosis is worse than suggested by pH and negative base excess, compounded by plasma water excess, corrected anion gap from hypoalbuminemia, and increased Pi.\\n- It explicitly states: \"There is no respiratory acidosis or alkalosis.\""

            "explanation": "- The manufacturer recommends holding clopidogrel for 5 days before major surgery, which aligns with its platelet half-life of 7 to 8 days.\\n- However, increasing data support the safe use of clopidogrel throughout the perioperative period.\\n- Elective vascular surgery is routinely performed on patients taking clopidogrel and aspirin.\\n- Two recent studies on clopidogrel use in elective and urgent general surgical procedures showed a slightly higher rate of transfusion but no higher risk of perioperative complications.\\n- One study showed a higher rate of cardiac complications in the group not on clopidogrel, challenging the standard practice.\\n- Continuance of clopidogrel through the perioperative period appears safe for most general surgical operations, including colectomy.\\n- Therefore, there is no need to hold clopidogrel preoperatively, and no need to administer platelets intraoperatively."
