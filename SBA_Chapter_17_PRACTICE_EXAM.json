            "question": "A 73-year-old woman is seen in the outpatients department. She complains of altered bowel habit and weight loss. A colonoscopy is performed which identifies a large polyp. Polypectomy was not possible due to the patient being on warfarin for a metal heart valve. You are asked to re-book the patient for definitive management. Which one of the following statements pertaining to this scenario is correct?\nA. Admission is required to monitor the patient while warfarin is stopped\nB. Warfarin should be replaced with therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin for 5 days prior to the procedure\nC. An echocardiogram is required prior to the procedure to exclude valve thrombus\nD. Conversion to unfractionated heparin infusion is required\nE. A computed tomography pneumocolon should be performed to identify/exclude further disease before a management decision is made",

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This is a common scenario encountered in any centre where proce-dural endoscopy is common. Removal of polyps can result in significant bleeding as the lesions are often well vascularized. Patients on warfarin require their INR to be normalized prior to an attempted procedure. In patients receiving warfarin for indications such as atrial fibrillation, warfarin must be stopped 5 days before the procedure. In patients with metal valves, however, the risk of thrombus formation on the valve dur-ing this time is too great, and therefore these patients should ideally be admitted and managed on a heparin infusion pump. This allows close, accurate and rapidly reversible anticoagulation which therefore mini-mizes the time that the patient's anticoagulation is below therapeutic levels in the peri-procedure period.\nLow-molecular-weight heparin is not appropriate as it needs to be stopped 48 hours prior to the procedure, during which the patient would not be adequately anticoagulated. The echocardiogram is unnecessary, as is the CT pneumocolon. The patient requires an inter-vention; finding a further polyp on CT will not affect the need for polypectomy."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Following an oesophagectomy, patients commonly become confused, either as a consequence of sepsis or simply due to the huge systemic impact of such major surgery on the body's physiology. Patients removing their own NG tube is a frequent (although not unavoidable) consequence of this and significantly complicates management. The NG tube func-tions to protect the anastomosis from forceful vomiting and dilatation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Removal at 4 days is not disastrous but requires careful management; instrumentation of the remnant oesopha-gus should be avoided and therefore options A and B are inappropriate. A CT scan is unnecessary in the absence of additional indications since NG removal is unlikely to be traumatic, unless an attempt has been made to reinsert.\nSedation does not address the issue highlighted in the case. Also, seda-tives may increase the likelihood of ileus and gastrointestinal disten-sion; if sedation is necessary benzodiazepines are probably preferable to antipsychotics such as haloperidol; however, even minor tranquillizers may cause gastrointestinal disturbance. Most important in this case is to limit oral intake and in doing so limit distension and the likelihood of vomiting."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is a term used to describe the disseminated response to an inflammatory insult such as sepsis, pancreatitis or severe trauma. The criteria for SIRS may be applied in the clinical definitions of certain conditions. For example, a patient may be said to have sepsis if they have the features of SIRS with a likely infective source. A patient is said to have SIRS if two or more of the following are present:\n1 Temperature <36°C or >38°C\n2 Heart rate >90 beats/min\n3 Respiratory rate >20 breaths/min or pCO2 <4.3 kPa\n4 White cell count >12 × 109/L or <4 × 109/L\nBlood pressure is not a consideration. However, if a patient is septic with a systolic BP of less than 90 mmHg, or there is a reduction in their systolic BP of >40 mmHg from their baseline, then they are said to be in septic shock."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Central venous catheters are commonly used in the management of sur-gical patients as they guide the fluid resuscitation of complex patients and allow the delivery of drugs and concentrated electrolytes which cannot otherwise be given. Therefore, candidates must familiarize themselves with the potential complications of such lines, which occur in approximately 20% of lines inserted.\nThe question asks specifically for the most common immediate compli-cation; this excludes line-associated sepsis, despite the fact that bacter-aemia is by far the most common complication overall. Of those options remaining, the majority of candidates should identify bleeding as the most likely immediate complication.\nNote: relative rates of complications differ between line sites. It is commonly held that femoral lines are more often associated with thrombus and infection, subclavian lines are more prone to haemor-rhage (due to the risk of arterial damage and the area being incom-pressible) and internal jugular lines are more prone to pneumothorax. However, in all line types, bleeding is the most common immediate adverse event."

The option of immediate surgery is discussed, but the patient opts to wait for 6 weeks. Ten days later the patient phones to ask advice; his pain has not improved and his fevers have returned following completion of the antibiotics, with rigors and night sweats now a problem. In addition, he is concerned regard-ing itching the previous day, which he ascribed to his antibiotics. The most appropriate advice for this patient is\nA. This is normal, paracetamol should relieve the fevers\nB. Surgery is now not possible for 6 weeks, attend general practitioner for further course of antibiotics and analgesics\nC.

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "An important consideration in patient management is that condi-tions are dynamic and clinical circumstances can easily change. Management must therefore also be dynamic and change when appropriate. Reading this scenario, candidates should identify that the new symptoms described by this unfortunate patient are no lon-ger consistent with his original diagnosis. Rigours suggest abscess formation or ascending biliary sepsis. Pruritus may indicate obstruc-tive jaundice and it would be appropriate to ask the patient about jaundice and colour changes in stool and urine. The patient probably has gallstones, and as such is at risk of obstructive jaundice with or without ascending cholangitis. A patient with these changes in his condition warrants reinvestigation and should therefore be readmit-ted urgently. Option E is incorrect since this patient requires urgent ERCP with decompression of his biliary tree. Cholecystectomy may still be deferred for 6 weeks."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Daily requirements of potassium may be calculated using the formula 1 mmol/kg per 24 hours. This will be increased in certain conditions, particularly in general surgical patients, in whom electrolyte and proton loss from the gastrointestinal tract is heavy. Therefore, candi-dates should be familiar with the safe administration of intravenous potassium.\nThe absolute maximum rate and concentration of infusion of potas-sium through a peripheral cannula is 20 mmol in 500 mL of fluid (nor-mal saline or dextrose) over 2–3 hours. Bolus potassium must never be given, it acts as a cardioplegic. Faster rates of infusion are possible in critical care scenarios where up to 40 mmol/100 mL per hour may be given through a central line. However, this is only advocated in extreme cases and would therefore be inappropriate in this case."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Hypophosphataemia may manifest as an arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, seizures or even cardiac arrest. Rhabdomyolysis and erythrocyte dysfunc-tion may also occur. Those at risk include the severely debilitated, those on TPN and those with severe diabetic ketoacidosis. Phosphate replacement can be problematic as it binds to serum calcium, causing severe hypocal-caemia and precipitating into tissues (metastatic calcification). For these reasons phosphate should preferentially be given orally. When this is not possible, or the deficit is profound, intravenous phosphate may be given, ideally via a central line, at a rate no more than 30 mmol over 6 hours (usually slower). Because of the potentially fatal, and incipient, conse-quences of hypophosphataemia these patients should always be treated."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Candidates should identify that this patient has a low potassium and low phosphate. A patient with a background of poor nutrition who has recently restarted eating should alert one to the possible diagnosis of ‘refeeding syndrome'. Those at particular risk are the homeless, alcohol-ics and those with anorexia nervosa. When the concentration camps of Nazi Germany were liberated, many of the prisoners are thought to have died from this phenomenon on release.\nThe mechanism is as follows. In the starved state, metabolism is mainly of fat and protein. Insulin levels are minimal due to the lack of dietary carbohydrate. The catabolic state also depletes intracellular stores of potassium and phosphate, with the serum levels usually remaining normal. Once feeding re-commences, insulin levels rise driving potas-sium and phosphate into cells. The effect is maximal at around day 4. This condition is potentially fatal, primarily from cardiac rhythm disturbance.\nMagnesium levels normally closely follow those of potassium and phos-phate. Its deficiency predisposes to seizure and arrhythmia. This patient requires close cardiac monitoring and urgent electrolyte replacement."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "This patient has a metabolic alkalosis. The base excess indicates an increased amount of base (bicarbonate) in the plasma. The rise in CO₂ is due to respiratory compensation; the body aims to retain carbon dioxide to reduce the bicarbonate load. Hartmann's solution contains 29 mmol of bicarbonate and is therefore the likely source of the excess alkali. This patient requires normal saline with potassium replacement; chloride is typically low, and its replacement aids bicarbonate excretion in the renal tubules. Increasing inhaled oxygen concentration might also be of benefit."

            "explanation": "The scenario describes a patient with a borderline urine output; a mini-mum acceptable output may be calculated using the patient's body mass (= 0.5 mL/kg/h). In all likelihood, this patient is hypovolaemic con-sidering their observations and history. Although options A and C are valid answers, a clinician must complete their assessment of the patient by taking account of the JVP and assessing the lung bases for signs of overload prior to administration of fluid. A better answer is option E: note the sudden cessation of urine output without change in vital parameters. More typical of hypovolaemia would be a gradual tailing of urine output with reciprocal changes in other observations. Sudden cessation such as this is highly suggestive of catheter occlusion; the catheter should be flushed and residual volume recorded. If this remains low and the patient is not in failure, fluid bolus would be the next appropriate course of action."

A loss of 30% of circulating volume is required before a child will become tachycardic – this being the earli-est indicator of hypovolaemia. At this point the child will typically be peripherally shut down; they will be cold to touch with weak pulses and prolonged capillary refill time. Narrowing of pulse pressure closely fol-lows tachycardia as the child compensates for reduced circulating vol-ume. At this degree of blood loss, a child will go from an irritable state to a state of lethargy, with a diminished pain response which becomes more apparent when inserting a peripheral cannula. Reduced urine out-put shortly precedes hypotension, as the child's compensatory mecha-nisms eventually fail. Hypotension in a child indicates that over 45% of circulating volume is lost and that the child is in imminent danger of cardiac arrest."

            "explanation": "Vascular access in paediatric patients is difficult due to the greater amounts of subcutaneous fat and due to the effectiveness of their own peripheral vasoconstriction. The ‘shut down' paediatric patient will be difficult for even experienced clinicians to cannulate. Once two attempts have failed, and if the clinical need is adequate, intraosseous infusion may be attempted in any patient, paediatric or adult. The normal posi-tion is a fingerbreadth below the tibial tuberosity. Contraindications include fracture proximal to this site or infection/abrasion over the intended site. Intraosseous infusion is preferred as it provides rapid access with fewer complications compared to other techniques. It should be discontinued as soon as peripheral access is achieved.\nAlternatives to intraosseous infusion (in order of preference) are femo-ral line insertion, saphenous cut-down and external jugular cannula-tion. Central line insertion into the internal jugular or subclavian vein is avoided in children."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Pregnancy induces a variety of physiological changes which prepare the body for the trauma of parturition. These adaptations influence vital signs and normal physiological parameters and therefore the emergency clinician should be familiar with them and able to interpret them accu-rately in a trauma scenario.\nPregnancy increases the plasma volume disproportionately with a similar increase in numbers of red blood cells. In other words, despite an overall increase in blood volume there is a decrease in haematocrit, so-called ‘physiological anaemia of pregnancy'. These changes allow a greater loss of blood volume, approximately 1200–1500 mL, before physiological signs of haemorrhagic shock become apparent. The white cell count increases to levels of 15-25 × 109/L depending on the stage of pregnancy.\nTidal volume increases secondary to actions of progesterone; this lowers the pCO2 and therefore baseline ABGs in a pregnant woman will typі-cally show hypocapnia. Cardiac output is increased by 1-1.5 L/min due to the increased plasma volume and reduced vascular resistance in the placenta, which receives 20% of blood at full term. There is a conse-quent increase in heart rate by 10–15 beats/min. Blood pressure initially falls below normal levels in the second trimester, but this resolves by the third term of pregnancy. Therefore hypotension in the third trimes-ter may be due to volume loss, or pressure effects of the gravid uterus compressing the vena cava and reducing venous return to the heart. The so-called 'supine hypotension syndrome' may reduce cardiac output by 30% and therefore pregnant women should be treated lying on their left side, or sat up, if injuries permit."

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Uterine rupture is most common in the third trimester when the uterine wall is at its thinnest and the uterus at its greatest point of expansion and therefore exposure; up to 12 weeks gestation the uterus remains within the bony pelvis, by 20 weeks it reaches the umbilicus, and at 34 weeks the costal margin. Blunt abdominal injury from seat belts is a common cause of uterine rupture and abruptio placentae. Such injuries are more common when the lap belt is worn in isolation, as it com-presses the uterus and allows forward flexion of the thorax over the gravid uterus; correct use of shoulder restraints in conjunction with lap belts minimizes risk.\nSigns of uterine rupture include those of haemoperitoneum, as well as an abnormal fetal lie and easy palpation of fetal extremities. Features on abdominal radiograph include air under the diaphragm, abnormal fetal lie and extension of fetal extremities outside of the confines of the uterus. In the above case, the certainty of the diagnosis and the compromised state of the mother precludes further delay in definitive treatment; therefore DPL and ultrasound are superfluous and CT should, in any case, be avoided in pregnancy. The choice is therefore between operative techniques, caesarean being inappropriate as it fails to allow sufficient access for a full exploration of the abdomen and exclusion of other compounding injuries. Thus, explorative laparotomy is indicated."

            "explanation": "The inherent pathophysiology of chronic pancreatitis is entirely dif-ferent from acute pancreatitis and the two diseases should be consid-ered different entities. There is continuing chronic inflammation within the gland, which causes the structure to be replaced by fibrous tissue and calcification.

Patients will often be malnourished not only because of their lifestyle, but also as a consequence of exocrine failure. Obstructive jaundice may also occur.\nIncidence is approximately 30/100,000 of the general population; 70% of sufferers have a history of significant alcohol overuse. Other causes are rarer; many cases are idiopathic, some are due to metabolic abnor-malities such as hyperlipidaemia and hypercalcaemia, and some are due to congenital or structural abnormalities, such as cystic fibrosis, choledochal cysts and pancreas divisum."

Such markers may be used in diagnosis or in monitoring response to treatment or detecting recurrence. Types of marker may be divided into hormones (e.g. ACTH, insulin), anti-gens (e.g. AFP), small peptides (e.g. vanillylmandelic acid, found in the urine of patients with phaeochromocytoma) and enzymes (e.g. PSA). Carcinoembryonic antigen is used to monitor bowel cancer reoccur-rence following attempted curative surgery, but may also be raised in smoking, cirrhosis and pancreatitis. a-fetoprotein is raised in 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma and 70% of testicular teratomas. Raised β-hCG is seen in pregnancy, but raised levels in a man suggest a possible diagnosis of testicular cancer; β-hCG is raised in 70% of teratomas, and 15% of seminomas. CA125 is raised in carcinoma of the ovary, uterus, breast and hepatocellular carcinoma, but may also be raised in peritoni-tis, cirrhosis and pregnancy. CA19–9 is raised in pancreatic and biliary tract malignancy, but may also be raised in colorectal cancer, biliary stasis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The most common cause of peptic ulcers is a bacterial infection called Helicobacter pylori. It causes 80% of peptic ulcers. H. pylori is a spi-ral-shaped Gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that infects the stomach and duodenum. It has been postulated that this bacteria is transmitted orally through waste contaminated food and water. H. pylori is responsible for causing 95% of duodenal ulcers and 80% of gastric ulcers. It predisposes to peptic ulcers by creating an inflam-matory environment within the stomach and duodenal mucosa. The inflammatory process removes the protective lining of gut mucosa, making it more susceptible to acid erosion which eventually leads to peptic ulceration.\nThe second most common cause of peptic ulcers is NSAIDs. These drugs are responsible for causing 20% of gastric ulcers and 5% of duodenal ulcers. Cigarette smoking, drinking vast amounts of caffeinated drinks and experiencing high levels of emotional stress are not direct causes of peptic ulcers, but can worsen the clinical symptoms and disease pro-gression of an established peptic ulcer. H. pylori infection can be con-firmed by a stool antigen test, a urea breath test or tissue biopsy (under endoscopic guidance) of the gastric mucosa. Chronic untreated H. pylori infection has been shown to increase the risk of gastric cancer."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "H. pylori-associated duodenal peptic ulcers are best treated using a triple therapy regimen. The NICE guidelines recommend that patients with proven H. pylori-associated peptic ulcers should be started on a 7-day triple therapy twice daily dosing of either a PPI with clarithro-mycin (500 mg) and amoxicillin (1 g) or a PPI with clarithromycin (500 mg) and metronidazole (400 mg). Omeprazole (20 mg) or lanso-prazole (30 mg) are generally prescribed but other PPIs (e.g. esome-prazole, pantoprazole) can also be used, but have not been shown to be significantly more effective than omeprazole and lansoprazole which are generally cheaper. Ranitidine (a histamine 2 receptor antagonist) is not as effective in suppressing stomach acid production and hence is not recommended in the treatment regimen of H. pylori-associated duodenal ulcers.\nTriple therapy has shown to be 85%–90% effective in eradicating H. pylori ulcers. Usually after 7 days of treatment, the patient can be placed on a 2-month course of low-dose once daily PPI to further aid healing of the peptic ulcer.\nTherefore, from the list, option A (omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithro-mycin) is the most appropriate."

            "explanation": "Recent weight loss and nodular hepatomegaly coupled with ascites and abdominal discomfort is suggestive that this patient has an underlying malignancy, making the most likely answer hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients can also present with jaundice. Hepatocellular carcinoma is common in countries where chronic hepatitis infection is prevalent and usually occurs against a background of cirrhosis secondary to infective hepatitis, excess alcohol or haemachromatosis. Aflatoxin, a metabolite of the Aspergillus species of fungi (mainly Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus) that grows in nuts, has been shown to be another risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma.\na-fetoprotein, a tumour marker, is usually raised and imaging (ultra-sound, CT, MRI) will confirm the presence of the tumour(s). Treatment involves chemotherapy as well as ablative therapies or surgical liver resection if feasible. Haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive dis-order of increased dietary iron absorption. It is more common in men usually over the age of 40. Systemic iron deposition may lead to cirrho-sis, diabetes, heart failure and skin pigmentation resulting in a tanned appearance. Diagnosis can be made with a liver biopsy. Pyogenic liver abscess usually presents with an insidious onset of swinging pyrexia, rigours, a tender palpable liver and jaundice. Diagnosis can be con-firmed by blood culturing and imaging. Alcoholic cirrhosis usually presents with jaundice, ascites and a smoothly enlarged liver (in the early stages, fatty liver). In the late stages of cirrhosis, the liver may be impalpable (due to fibrosis) because of chronic inflammation of the liver caused by the alcohol."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Options A and C should both be regarded as an indication for surgical intervention in ulcerative colitis and therefore cannot be the answer in this case. Previous pelvic surgery can complicate the procedure immensely, but should not prevent lifesaving surgery, although it may change the threshold at which a surgeon may contemplate intervention. Similarly, in cases of young female patients, adequate consideration should be made of the effect on fertility, with an increase in ectopic pregnancy risk and reduction in fertility by 50% due to pelvic adhesions after surgery. Adequate patient counselling is therefore paramount before agreeing on a management strategy, the alternative options being total colectomy with ileo-rectal anastomosis, which carries less risk to fertility, but can result in a symptomatic rectal remnant being left behind.\nThe only absolute contraindication for this type of surgery is toxic megacolon. In the acute setting, pan-proctocolectomy carries an unac-ceptably high mortality rate, as well as high leak rate if a pouch anas-tomosis is attempted. Surgery of this complexity in the acutely unwell patient with an unprepared, inflamed bowel is therefore avoided in favour of a total abdominal colectomy with ileostomy and preservation of the rectum. This removes the diseased bowel, avoids the complex and morbid pelvic dissection, and allows for definitive management once the patient's clinical condition has been stabilized. This may well include a completion proctectomy with ileoanal anastomosis as an elec-tive second operation."

With the patient lying in the lithotomy position, an imaginary trans-verse line is drawn from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock centred on the anal canal. A fistula with its external opening anterior to this line typі-cally has a straight radial tract leading to its internal orifice.

An external orifice posterior to the transverse line will typically follow a curved tract and open internally at the 6 o'clock position, such as in this case."

The at-risk populations are immigrants and the home-less, as well as the immunocompromised.\nPsoas abscesses form when pus tracts down the sheath of the psoas muscle, presenting as abdominal pain, fever and an iliac fossa mass. Extension below the inguinal ligament results in a groin swelling. On examination, it is often possible to empty the iliac fossa swelling into the groin swelling, and vice versa. Worldwide, psoas abscesses are most commonly associated with tuberculous abscesses of the lumbar spine, hence the back pain in this case. Psoas abscesses may also be caused by non-mycobacteria; any pyogenic gastrointestinal or urological infec-tion may be causative, although the presentation is typically more acute with sepsis and erythematous, warm swelling of the afflicted area.

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Diarrhoea in Crohn's disease may be due to bile acid malabsorption sec-ondary to disease or resection of the terminal ileum. Increased delivery of bile salts into the colon irritates the bowel wall and causes diarrhoea.\nPrescribing a bile acid sequester such as cholestyramine can reduce symptoms by 30%–40%.\nAntimotility agents such as codeine and loperamide should be avoided in IBD because of the risk of propagating paralytic ileus. A bulking agent in this scenario would not deal with the root cause of the diar-rhoea and is unlikely to be effective. As there is no evidence of active inflammation in this patient, methotrexate would be inappropriate."

The abdomen is washed to remove contaminated debris. Hartmann's procedure is commonly performed for perforated diverticulitis or emergency large bowel obstruction. The affected sigmoid colon is resected and the rectal stump is oversewn and left within the pelvis. The proximal end is surfaced and stitched to the skin and usually acts as a temporary left iliac fossa colostomy. The temporary colostomy can be reanastomosed to the rectal stump a few months after surgery; this allows for the inflammation, sec-ondary to bacterial contamination and surgery, to resolve, which improves the rate of success of reanastomosis (if not contraindicated).\nHigh rectal tumours are treated by anterior resection whereby the rec-tal tumour is removed and the rectal stump is anastomosed with the colon above it. Low rectal tumours are treated with the abdominoperi-neal resection whereby the rectum and anus are excised and a perma-nent colostomy is made. See Section 5 for more information regarding colonic resections."

            "explanation": "Generally, breast tumours can spread via four main routes:\n• Direct extension – To surrounding structures such as muscle and to the chest wall.\n• Lymphatic spread – Cancer cells can then block the lymphatic drainage in certain areas of the body causing oedema and changes in the overlying skin.\n• Haematogenous spread – Micrometastatic cancer cells can spread via blood vessels and infiltrate bone, lungs, liver and brain.\n• Transcoelomic spread – This is a term used to describe invasion of the serosal lining of an organ by malignant cells. The malig-nant cells trigger an inflammatory response which results in the formation of serous exudates. These exudates then collect in a coelomic cavity, such as the pleural space/cavity.\nIn this case, the effusion has occurred due to dissemination of malig-nant cells to the pleura resulting in the formation of malignant pleural seedings. These seedings undergo an inflammatory process which gen-erates serous exudates into the pleural cavity."

The tumours which express oestrogen alone can respond to hormonal treatment, but to a lesser extent when compared with oestrogen- and progesterone-positive tumours. The tumours which are oestrogen negative tend to express high levels of HER-2 neu transmembrane receptors. These are members of the tyrosine kinase receptors, which have shown to respond to trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular portion of the HER-2 neu receptor and thus the cancer cells undergo arrest during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, resulting in decreased cell proliferation."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Polyuria, polydipsia and muscle cramps coupled with high sodium and low potassium suggests that this patient has Conn's syndrome. Conn's syndrome results from an aldosterone-secreting adenoma of the adrenal gland. The excessive amounts of aldosterone leads to increased sodium and water retention and enhances potassium excretion which results in high blood pressure. Hypokalaemia ensues, which is characterized by muscle cramps and polyuria (which occurs secondary to renal tubular damage). This condition can be diagnosed by measuring serum aldoste-rone and renin levels, which reveal raised aldosterone and renin titres. Managing this patient involves administering an aldosterone antagonist (e.g. oral spironolactone), and surgical resection of the adenoma once it has been localized with CT.\nCushing's syndrome is the result of raised levels of serum cortisol. Causes include a pituitary adenoma (Cushing's disease), adrenal hyperplasia or neoplasia and ectopic ACTH. The main clinical features of Cushing's syndrome include polyuria, polydipsia, hypertension, increased weight, moon face, central obesity, insulin resistance leading to hyperglycae-mia and diabetes mellitus, thinning of the skin and striae and hirsut-ism. This patient is normoglycaemic and thus Cushing's syndrome can be ruled out.\nThis patient does not raise or decrease serum calcium levels, which would be seen in hyperparathyroidism and hypoparathyroidism, respectively. Phaeochromocytoma is a neuroendocrine tumour of the adrenal glands originating from the chromaffın cells. Patients present with hypertension, tachycardia and palpitations, anxiety, headaches and weight loss. Diagnosis can be made by measuring catecholamines and metanephrines in blood or urine (24-hour urine collection)."

            "explanation": "Paroxysmal flushing, diarrhoea, breathlessness (due to bronchospasm) and abdominal pain, precipitated by stress, alcohol and caffeine, are symptoms highly suggestive of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid tumours arise from the enterochromaffın cells of the gastrointestinal tract (mostly small intestine and appendix). Typically, these tumours secrete serotonin (5-HT), which is transported to the liver and broken down into harmless products. When carcinoid secondaries form in the liver, the secreted 5-HT bypasses liver metabolism and is released into the blood stream where the above described symptoms are experienced (also known as carcinoid syndrome). This condition can be diagnosed by measuring 24-hour urinary 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid, a break-down product of serotonin. General management of this condition involves either surgical resection of the primary tumour or, in meta-static disease, with a somatostatin analogue (e.g. octreotide) for symp-tomatic treatment.\nThe 24-hour urinary vanillylmandelic acid test is used in the diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma. The dexamethasone suppression test is used for diagnosing Cushing's syndrome. Aldosterone and renin levels may be measured for the diagnosis of Conn's syndrome. The short Synacthen test can be used to assess the cortisol-secreting efficiency of the adrenal glands and aid the diagnosis of Addison's disease."

With an increase in upper limb physical activity, there is an increase in the demand for oxygenated blood, and the affected arm ‘steals' blood from the posterior arterial cerebral circulation. The resulting symptoms include muscular pain and fatigue in the affected arm, dizziness, vertigo and in some cases, syncope. There are reduced blood pressure measurements in the affected arm and, there may be weak or absent pulses distal to the site of the occlusion. Initial investigations include duplex ultrasound and angiography will usually localize the proximal subclavian occlu-sion. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is usually performed to revascularize the occlusion. If PTA fails, bypass grafting using reversed saphenous vein or synthetic grafts such as PTFE can be used to bypass the occlusion and revascularize the affected arm."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis here is superficial thrombophlebitis (inflam-mation of superficial veins) which is commonly associated with recent trauma (i.e. in this case, multiple attempts of intravenous cannulae insertion), varicose veins, malignancy and thromboangiitis obliter-ans (a progressive occlusive disease of the blood vessels in the lower extremities associated with cigarette smoking). The patient usually presents with pain and swelling at the site where the superficial vein is inflamed (i.e. site of trauma, varicose veins, etc.). On palpation the vein feels hard and the overlying skin is erythematous and swollen. Management involves removing the underlying cause and treating symptoms with ice packs and NSAIDs. This condition is self-limiting and will usually resolve within 2–3 days. Complications of superficial thrombophlebitis include abscess formation, which will require drain-age and antibiotic cover.\nCellulitis is a bacterial infection of the connective tissue underlying the skin. Patients usually present with symptoms similar to superficial thrombophlebitis in addition to fever, nausea and headaches. Common organisms include normal skin flora and Group A streptococcus. If the bacteria penetrate deeper tissues, this can lead to necrotizing fasci-itis. Lymphangitis is an acute bacterial infection of the lymphatic ves-sels characterized by painful, red streaks below the skin surface which travel from the site of the infection to the armpits or groin. Associated symptoms include fever, muscle aches and nausea. The most common causative organism is Streptococcus pyogenes and in some cases, staph-ylococci. This is a life-threatening infection and leads to widespread sepsis if prompt treatment is not initiated. Although blood cultures will identify the causative organism, antibiotic therapy should be started immediately if this condition is suspected."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Hydrocele is a collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis. Hydroceles are termed primary, i.e. cause unknown (the predominant type espe-cially in children and those over 40 years of age), or secondary to trauma, infection or neoplasm. Patients present mainly with a swelling in the scrotum or an increase in the size of the testis. On examination, it is possible to get above a hydrocele, but as the swelling is within the testis, it is not palpable as a separate entity. Additionally, is it not possi-ble to reduce the swelling, which would distinguish it from an inguino-scrotal hernia. The fluid within a hydrocele is typically protein-rich and has a clear yellow colour. If large, there is a fluid thrill on palpation and dullness to percussion. Classically, a hydrocele transilluminates brightly when a light is shone through.\nInguino-scrotal hernia occurs as a result of weakness of the deep inguinal ring through which intra-abdominal viscera can pass, exit-ing through the superficial ring and descending into the scrotum. On examination it is not possible to get above the swelling and a cough impulse will be present. In addition, the swelling is frequently reducible and may be controlled with pressure over the deep ring. The testis and epididymis will also be palpable separate to the hernia and, finally, the structure is opaque to light shone behind it.\nSpermatocele is a type of epididymal cyst containing slightly grey, opaque fluid and few spermatozoa. The condition is diagnosed follow-ing fluid aspiration and microscopic examination. Physical examina-tion will reveal a swelling in the scrotum above and behind the testis, which is separately palpable. It is usually multilocular and may pro-trude onto the testicular surface allowing individual loculi to be pal-pable. Presentation is similar to that of a hydrocele but the ability to palpate the testis separately distinguishes the two conditions.\nA varicocele is a bunch of dilated and tortuous veins of the pampini-form plexus (the venous supply of the testis). These are akin to varicose veins of the spermatic cord. They are more common on the left hemi-scrotum and may result in a vague, dragging sensation and dull ache in the scrotum/groin. Varicoceles may be primary or secondary to a left-sided renal tumour (testicular artery branches off the left renal artery). The patient with suspected varicocele must be examined standing up as the veins empty on lying flat. The veins are often visible and palpable and classically have the feel of a ‘bag of worms'. Management is either conservative with a scrotal support, embolization of the testicular vein under radiological guidance (the preferred method), or surgically by clipping the testicular vein.\nMost patients with a testicular tumour will present with a painless lump in the testicle although a small proportion may present with testicular pain. The lump is mostly confined to the scrotum, with the testis and epididymis palpable separately. The lump will also be opaque to light. Definitive diagnosis lies in further tests such as ultrasonography."

            "explanation": "Testicular torsion is a surgical emergency most common in males aged 10–25 years. It is commonly preceded by a trivial exertion or trauma, presenting initially as poorly localized pain in the abdomen and loin (the testicle is supplied by the T10 dermatomal level). Severe testicu-lar pain and tenderness follows, usually affecting a single testicle. The pain can be accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting. On exami-nation the testicle can be hot, swollen and extremely tender to touch. Classically the testicle lies horizontally and is high riding. Symptoms progress rapidly over hours and, as the twisting of the testis within the tunica vaginalis compromises the testicular blood supply, leave only a short window in which the testicle is salvageable. A scrotal explora-tion should be performed as soon as possible in suspected cases of tor-sion with derotation of the testis and three-point fixation of both the affected and unaffected testicle within the scrotum (orchidopexy).\nThe first four options for management are appropriate when prepar-ing a patient for most surgical procedures. Given the urgent nature of testicular torsion, requesting an ultrasound scan would cause delay in definitive treatment and could lead to the loss of a potentially viable testis. As a result, in cases of suspected testicular torsion, it is the norm to perform a scrotal examination under general anaesthesia and treat as indicated, i.e. orchidectomy if the testicle is not viable, or orchidopexy."

However, correct interpretation of the neurological findings and knowledge of the functional anatomy of the forearm will allow localization of the lesion. Note that the patient has a clawing deformity of the hand; this occurs in ulnar nerve palsies, which affect the intrinsic muscles of the hands but spare the flexor carpi ulnaris and flexor digitorum profundus. The so-called ulnar paradox refers to lesions of this type; proximal lesions do not spare the long flexors whereas distal injury spares the long flex-ors, but in doing so allows unopposed action to cause the ulnar clawing, which may be very disabling.\nThe ulnar nerve lesion is therefore a distal one, branching within the forearm, which therefore excludes options A, C and D. Also, the sensa-tion to the hand is spared. The ulnar nerve branches into various com-ponents: the dorsal, palmar and digital branches supply the hypothenar muscles and sensation; and the deep branch supplies the interossei and adductor pollicis and travels through the ulnar tunnel (this is a bony passage between the hook of the Hamate and pisiform bones). Compression at this point can occur following degenerative change (often secondary to a fracture of the carpel bones) or the formation of a ganglion. Suspicions are confirmed by the positive Froment's test (a test of adductor pollicis) and the absence of hypothenar wasting."

            "explanation": "A fall onto an outstretched hand in childhood may result in a supra-condylar fracture; the fracture pattern is a transverse break just above the level of the epicondyles. The distal fragment is pulled dorsally by the action of the triceps muscle, kinking the brachial artery and inter-rupting the vascular supply to the forearm. Often this is complicated by vessel dissection, and early involvement of a vascular surgeon and urgent open exploration is commonly required. Management requires restoration of flow to prevent ischaemic injury to the muscle compart-ments and permanent disability (Volkmann's ischaemic contracture).\nDamage to other structures is common, although not the ulnar or radial arteries; these are distal to the fracture site and therefore cannot be considered valid answers. The musculocutaneous nerve branches from the brachial plexus and travels within the body of the biceps, and is therefore protected from injury. The radial nerve travels posteriorly and therefore does not become bowstringed over the fracture site when the distal segment is displaced by the action of the triceps. This puts it at less risk than the brachial artery, and the closely associated median nerve, which are stretched over the proximal fractured humerus when the distal end is displaced. Therefore, the most commonly damaged structures are the brachial artery and medial nerve, although the ulnar nerve, and less commonly the radial nerve, may also be compromised."

Much of this confusion is attributable to incorrect use of the term 'neck of femur fracture' to include extracapsular fractures such as intertrochan-teric and subtrochanteric fractures. These fractures are not fractures of the neck of the femur; they do not compromise the vascular sup-ply of the femoral head and therefore they are managed differently. Intertrochanteric fractures are generally fixed using a dynamic hip screw. This device consists of a single screw head which is mobile (i.e. 'dynamic') on a plate attached to the lateral cortex of the femur. The screw is then drilled through the centre of the femoral neck and into the head. This stabilizes the femoral neck, allowing impaction of the frac-ture surfaces, but not displacement or angle deformity. Subtrochanteric fractures are less common, but typically fixed using a proximal intra-medullary nail."

            "explanation": "The scenario describes respiratory failure immediately following sur-gery. All diagnoses in the list are possible causes with the excep-tion of haemorrhage. Myocardial infarction may cause respiratory failure if complicated by acute left ventricular failure. Intraoperative fluid overload may also complicate immediate postoperative recovery but with both of these one would expect crepitations on listening to the chest, as you would in the presence of pneumonia. The probable cause is therefore a deficit in pulmonary perfusion, which may be due to thromboembolism or fat embolism. Thromboembolic disease is extremely common in hip fracture and surgery complicating up to 50% of cases. However, thromboemboli typically occur 2–3 days post-operatively. Immediately following an operation the cause that must be excluded is fat emboli, which occurs in up to 1% of cases, particu-larly where cement is used. The distinction is difficult but is impor-tant since thromboembolism requires management with anticoagulant therapy, with the obvious propensity for further complications in the postoperative patient."

The most sensitive feature on examination is pain on pas-sive flexion of the affected compartment.

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Various problems with fracture union can occur and candidates should be able to identify the main features of each to distinguish between them on radiographs. Avascular necrosis occurs when a fracture inter-rupts the blood supply to a part of a bone. This only occurs in a small number of sites because the bones typically receive a good supply from various sources and are therefore protected from this phenomenon. The ‘at risk' sites are the femoral neck and head, scaphoid and talus. Radiographically the appearance is of sclerosis with distortion of shape and structure. Malunion is when a fracture heals in an abnormal posi-tion. Delayed union is when a fracture heals normally but takes a pro-longed period of time. Non-union is when the fracture surfaces fail to unite; there are two types, hypertrophic and atrophic. In hypertrophic non-union there is an abundance of callus but no union; this may be due to excess movement across the fracture site or due to interposed tis-sues. Atrophic non-union occurs when the body makes no effort to heal and no callus forms. The bony ends often appear osteopenic, and this is more common in the elderly, the malnourished or generally debilitated."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "This is a two-stage question which requires a clinical diagnosis to be made, followed by knowledge about the disease, for the question to be answered.\nThe description is of myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disease in which antibodies develop against the postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor, resulting in reduced receptor numbers at the neuromuscular junction. Young adults are most susceptible, presenting with increasing muscle fatigability that initially is worse with exertion and relieved by rest but can progress to a permanent weakness. Muscles of the eye (presenting with ptosis and diplopia), face, neck, trunk and distal limbs can be affected. Twenty per cent of individuals will have an associated tumour of the thymus (which is involved in T-lymphocyte production). Incidence is also increased in patients with other autoimmune condi-tions such as hyperthyroidism, RA and SLE. Treatment takes a variety of forms:\n• Symptomatic control is obtained by using anticholinesterase agents such as pyridostigmine, edrophonium (also a diagnos-tic agent) and neostigmine, which increases the amount of available acetylcholine, but can be associated with cholinergic toxicity.\n• Immunosuppression with prednisolone or azathioprine can be beneficial in some individuals.\n• Thymectomy in the presence of a thymoma can produce disease remission in around 33% of patients and symptom reduction in another 40%.\n• Plasmapheresis is used in emergency cases for short-term symp-tomatic relief.\nThe ẞ2-adrenergic receptor is found in many body cells and its ago-nists include adrenaline and noradrenaline (together with many phar-macological agents). Its effects include smooth muscle relaxation and dilatation of small blood vessels. The H₂ histamine receptor is located on gastric parietal (oxyntic) cells. Binding of histamine to this recep-tor results in the production of gastric acid and intrinsic factor. The presynaptic acetylcholine receptor may be affected in the myasthenic syndrome, a condition associated with bronchial small cell carci-noma (together known as Eaton-Lambert syndrome). Here, the muscle strength and reflexes are improved by repeated contractions, unlike true myasthenia gravis. y-amino butyric acid (GABA) is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human body and acts on the GABA receptor, of which three varieties (A, B, C) are known."

            "explanation": "Friedrich's ataxia is a hereditary ataxia inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion due to a gene defect on chromosome 9 coding the protein frataxin. This results in the loss of dorsal root ganglia cells and degeneration of peripheral sensory fibres, the lateral corticospinal tracts and dorsal columns. It usually presents in early adulthood with progressive difficulty walking due to muscle wasting, a broad based (ataxic) gait, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus, dysarthria, loss of fine touch and proprioception (due to effects on the dorsal columns), loss of deep tendon reflexes and an extensor plantar response (Babinski's reflex). Associated systemic features include diabetes, scoliosis, pes cavus (club foot) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Treatment is symp-tomatic only and most patients die in their mid-thirties.\nGenetic defects on chromosome 4 are associated with Huntington's cho-rea, an autosomal dominant disease resulting in an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat. The condition usually presents with depres-sion, cognitive impairment, poor memory and jerky, involuntary, dance-like movements. The accumulation of trinucleotide repeats increases with successive generations causing symptoms and death to occur at a younger age in children as compared to their parents. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome associated with mutation in the raf-1 oncogene on chromosome 3. The disease results in the formation of haemangioblastomas in the cer-ebellum. The spinal canal and retina, which can cause hydrocepha-lus, ataxia, cord compression and subretinal haemorrhage (leading to blindness), respectively. The condition is also associated with systemic pathology such as renal cell carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma. Death is often the result of these many varied systemic pathologies."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The CSF is a clear, watery fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and brain, cushioning the latter from contact with the skull and reducing its weight. It is produced by the choroids plexus in the lateral, third and fourth ventricles and circulates there, in the central canal and in the subarachnoid space. It is absorbed by the arachnoid villi that project into the superior sagittal sinus. The CSF normally has a clear appear-ance, a white cell count of <5 cells/mm³ (predominantly mononuclear cells), a glucose of 2.8–4.2 mmol/L (about half to two-thirds of the blood glucose level) and a protein count of 0.15–0.45 g/L.\nSubarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) is the accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space. It is the result of either trauma or a spontaneous process. Most spontaneous bleeds are the result of rupture of intracranial berry aneurysms (~75%), which occur at the bifurcations of the circle of Willis in association with polycystic kidney disease/connective tis-sue disorders; a further minority result from arterio-venous malforma-tion, vasculitis, clotting disorders and an extending carotid dissection. In approximately 20% of cases, the cause is unknown. Subarachnoid haemorrhage most commonly presents with a sudden onset (thunder-clap) headache, often described as the worst headache ever experienced by the patient, signs of meningism (i.e. neck stiffness and photophobia), focal neurological deficit and a depressed consciousness level. The pres-ence of a greater number of these signs carries a higher mortality.\nThe investigation of choice is a head CT scan, which will detect approxi-mately 98% of bleeds. If there is no haematoma, mass lesion or hydro-cephalus, a lumbar puncture is performed 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. This will usually demonstrate equal numbers of blood cells (and a similar appearance) in tubes 1 and 3 on CSF collection. However, this may also occur in a traumatic tap, although the CSF should nor-mally be clear. A bloody tap is spun down and the supernatant decanted to test for xanthochromia (yellow colour), which is the result of the breakdown of the haemoglobin within red blood cells, and diagnos-tic of SAH. Treatment can be medical and/or surgical depending on the severity of the bleed. An urgent neurosurgical opinion is needed if there is reduced consciousness or focal neurology to consider haema-toma evacuation. Further surgical intervention is considered to reduce the risk of re-bleeding, which occurs in around 30% of patients and can be more severe and life-threatening than the initial bleed. Surgical methods include clipping of identifiable aneurysms or insertion of coils into their lumen to promote thrombosis."

Infection is the result of the varicella zoster virus (VZV), a double-stranded (ds) DNA virus, responsible for chickenpox (varicella) and shingles. Following a bout of childhood chickenpox, the virus lies dormant in the dorsal root gan-glion of the spinal cord, trigeminal or geniculate ganglion. Reactivation of the virus can lead to shingles, Ramsay-Hunt syndrome or herpes zoster ophthalmicus (trigeminal herpes zoster). Classically, Ramsay-Hunt syndrome presents with a vesicular rash in the external auditory meatus (or over the pinna), sudden facial paralysis in a lower motor neurone distribution which can be preceded by severe pain, loss of taste sensation in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and dry mouth and eyes. The symptoms are the result of loss of sensory, motor and para-sympathetic functions of the facial nerve. The vestibulocochlear nerve lies close to the geniculate ganglion, such that the zoster virus may also affect its function, resulting in deafness and tinnitus.

The abdominal cavity then continues to grow and by week 12 of development the herniated abdominal contents return to the abdominal cavity. The umbilical ring then constricts with a small defect for the umbilical vessels that nourish the developing fetus. After birth, the vessels thrombose and fibrous tissue plugs the defect. The failure of this process results in a congenital umbilical hernia.\nThe hernia can commonly enlarge when a child cries but rarely stran-gulates due to the presence of a wide base. They require no specific treatment and the defect usually closes by the age of 4. However, surgi-cal repair can be considered should the hernia persist after the age of 3."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer) is a slow growing malignant tumour of the skin, predominantly affecting the central portion of the face and is directly related to sun exposure. It begins as a raised nodule with venules crossing its central portion, which can collapse and ulcerate and invade locally to form large lesions (the rodent ulcer). The classical presentation is with a rolled pearly edge. Treatment is dependent on the site and the size of the ulcer but most commonly consists of surgical excision, curettage and radiotherapy, if large.\nKeratoacanthoma (molluscum sebaceum) is a lesion occurring in mid-dle-aged individuals, most commonly in hair-bearing areas. It is related to sun exposure and consists of a lesion that grows over many months as a domed swelling with a central plug of keratin. The keratin plug can fall off, leaving a bleeding floor. If managed conservatively, it usu-ally regresses over many months to leave a small scar. Excision allows a definitive diagnosis between keratoacanthoma and malignancy.\nSquamous cell carcinoma occurs commonly on exposed areas of the body such as the head, neck, hands and trunk, which are repeatedly exposed to sunlight. It consists of an ulcer that has an everted edge (unlike the rolled edge of BCC) and is dark brown in colour. Squamous cell carcinoma commonly begins as a small nodule on the skin, becom-ing necrotic in its centre as it enlarges and forms an ulcer. Solar (senile) keratoses are scaly lesions occurring mainly in elderly individuals who have had chronic sun exposure. Malignant change can occur in 25% of lesions, necessitating excision. Papilloma are small epidermal tumours relating to human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. They are benign lesions that occur as sessile or pedunculated structures."

Incidence is increased in individuals with fairer skin tones and increased exposure to UV radiation. This presentation is of a superficial spreading melanoma, which makes up 70% of melanomas. It spreads superficially in the epidermis initially and becomes invasive after many months or years. The lesion margin and surface tend to be irregular and pigmented. It can be surrounded by an area of inflamma-tion and generally carries a poor prognosis.\nLentigo maligna melanoma is a slow growing, irregularly pigmented macule that can be present for many years and usually occurs in exposed areas in elderly individuals. Nodular melanoma consists of a dark nodule, commonly occurring in middle-aged men. It has a poor prognosis because of invasive growth from the start of its develop-ment. Acral melanoma occurs on the palms and soles and in the nail bed of affected individuals. Prognosis depends on the lesion thickness (i.e. depth) as measured from the granular layer to the deepest layer of invasion, using Clark's and/or Breslow classification. Overall 5-year survival is 75% in women and 60% in men."

They are guided by the gubernaculum into the scro-tum, usually entering this structure at between 28 and 34 weeks gesta-tion. Ectopic testis refers to the deviation of a descending testicle from its normal line of descent into an abnormal position. As a result, the testicle may lie at the base of the penis, in the superficial inguinal pouch, within the perineum or in the femoral triangle of the thigh. Individuals may present with an absent testis or pain, if the ectopic testis (a smooth, sensi-tive, ovoid swelling) is on a site that is likely to be rubbed or pressed in the course of normal daily activity.\nWhen a testis follows the correct anatomical path of descent but does not reach its final position in the scrotum, it is referred to as a truly undescended testis. Undescended testes are more commonly found in premature babies, 30% of whom may have undescended testes. In term infants, the incidence decreases to 3%, while in children of 1 year of age, this is further reduced to 1%. Spontaneous descent after that age is very rare. The line of testicular descent crosses the external inguinal ring and neck of the scrotum, where 80% of undescended testes are typ-ically found and can be palpable on examination. Presence in either of these areas is an indication for orchidopexy, whereby the testis is fixed in the scrotum between the dartos muscle and skin, by the age of 18 months, to prevent testicular damage. After age 2 years, the testis can become damaged and incapable of spermatogenesis. Truly undescended and ectopic testes are potentially complicated by:\n• Infertility – A near inevitability in individuals with bilateral undescended (and common in those with unilateral unde-scended) testes\n• Torsion\n• Trauma\n• Inguinal hernia\n• Malignant disease\nAlthough failure of descent/ectopic testes are associated with abnormal spermatogenesis and infertility, hormone-producing cells of the testes function normally, resulting in puberty and the development of second-ary sexual characteristics."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The tunica vaginalis normally covers the anterior and lateral testis and part of the epididymis, thereby fixing it in the scrotum and prevent-ing twist. Normal variations in the extent that the tunica vaginalis covers the body of the testis means that the testicle is liable to twist on its attachment. Testicular torsion is most common in males aged 10–25 years. It is a surgical emergency, preceded by a trivial exertion or trauma, presenting initially as poorly localized pain in the abdomen and loin (the testicle is supplied by the T10 dermatomal level). Severe testicular pain and tenderness follows, usually affecting a single tes-ticle. The pain can be accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting. On examination, the testicle can be hot, swollen, extremely tender to touch and is classically high riding with a horizontal lie. Symptoms progress rapidly over hours and, as the twisting of the testis within the tunica vaginalis compromises the testicular blood supply, leave only a short window in which the testicle is salvageable. A scrotal exploration should be performed as soon as possible in suspected cases of torsion with derotation of the testis and three point fixation of both the affected and unaffected testicle within the scrotum.\nTorted hydatid of Morgagni (also known as torsion of the testicular appendage) is the commonest lesion presenting in a similar manner to testicular torsion (however, it does not result in compromise of the tes-ticular blood supply). The appendix testis (or hydatid of Morgagni) is a vestigial remnant of the Müllerian duct, present on the upper pole of the testis in 90% of men and attached to the tunica vaginalis. The testicular appendage can become torted, causing acute one-sided testicular pain and requiring surgical excision to achieve relief. A third of patients present with a palpable 'blue dot' discoloration on the scrotum, which is diagnostic of the condition.\nEpididymo-orchitis is an inflammation of the testis and epididymis sec-ondary to infection, e.g. mumps in the young and bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli, Chlamydia and gonorrhoea in adults and the elderly. Patients can present with acute onset testicular pain, fever, malaise, urethral discharge and symptoms of UTI. The testis itself can be tender, red and warm to touch. The epididymis will be swollen and is palpable separate to the testis. Treatment is supportive with bed rest, antibiotic cover, and analgesia. Pain can also be relieved by elevation of the testis, which is not possible in cases of torsion.\nAn epididymal cyst is a fluid-filled swelling arising from the collecting tubules of the epididymis. Patients tend to be middle-aged and present with a normally painless swelling (although occasionally painful in younger adults) in the scrotum that has grown larger over many years. The cyst occurs supero-posteriorly to the testis and can be palpated separately, while the spermatic cord can be felt superior to the swelling. The cyst may be loculated and fluctuant to palpation and is irreduc-ible. The presentation of inguinal hernia is discussed elsewhere in this section."

Seminomas tend to affect an older population, in the age range of 20–40. They arise from germinal cells in the testes and are usually solid and slow growing. These tumours are associated with an elevation primarily of placental alkaline phospha-tase but approximately 15% of patients will have a raised β-hCG level.\nTesticular tumours occur more commonly in individuals with unde-scended testicles, infertile parents and in the presence of a contralat-eral testicular malignancy. Patients typically present with a painless testicular mass that is irregular, firm, fixed and does not ransilluminate. These tumours are staged according to the Royal Marsden Classification:\n• Stage 1 - Tumour confined to testis\n• Stage 2 - Abdominal nodal spread\n• Stage 3 Nodal disease outside the abdomen\n• Stage 4 - Extralymphatic spread\nFive-year survival for metastatic disease is 75% and 45% for semino-mas and teratomas, respectively.

Varicoceles may be primary or secondary to a left-sided renal tumour (testicular artery branches off the left renal artery). The patient with suspected varicocele must be examined standing up as the veins empty on lying flat. The veins are often visible and palpable and classically have the feel of a ‘bag of worms'. Varicoceles are managed either conservatively with a scrotal support, via embolization of the testicular vein under radiological guidance (the preferred method) or surgically by clipping the testicular vein.\nA haematocele is a collection of blood in the tunica vaginalis, with bleeding usually secondary to trauma or underlying malignant disease.

            "explanation": "Fibroadenoma is a benign breast neoplasm primarily affecting young women aged 15–35. It results from a dominant fibromatous element in breast tissue with a cut surface revealing lobules of whorled, white fibrous tissue that bulge out of their capsule. Two histological vari-ants are documented: pericanalicular in which fibrous tissue dominates and intracanalicular where glandular tissue is more prominent. The two types are clinically indistinguishable. Presentation is as a painless, slow-growing and well-defined lump of rubbery consistency. The lumps can be hypermobile and are also known as ‘breast mice'. Reassurance is usually sufficient as most lesions regress spontaneously. However, lesions >4 cm in size or occurring in older women should be excised to exclude malignancy.\nPhylloides (Brodie's) tumour is a variant of fibroadenoma found in older women. These slow-growing tumours can grow extremely large but remain as a smooth swelling. They are usually excised to exclude malignancy and for cosmesis. They can also result in skin necrosis in advanced cases. Breast cysts are fluid-filled cavities in the breast with-out a demonstrable endothelial lining or capsule. Their presentation is similar to that of fibroadenoma, but they occur more commonly in women in their forties to early fifties as a result of a changing hormonal environment in preparation of the menopause. Women may present with a history of a sudden large swelling that may or may not be associated with pain and tenderness. Solitary cysts are smooth, spherical and of a variable consistency from soft/cystic to hard. Large cysts can be visible through the skin. An immediate aspiration of a cyst will reveal a yellow to dark green coloured fluid, which will confirm the clinical diagnosis and relieve patient symptoms.\nFibroadenosis is a condition that occurs as part of the normal spec-trum of breast changes associated with the menstrual cycle. It occurs in young women, usually between the ages of 15–35 years, and is asso-ciated with lumpiness, especially in the upper outer quadrant of the breast, with or without cyclical pain. Physical examination can reveal single or multiple tender lumps. Investigation is with triple assessment: clinical examination, fine needle aspiration cytology and mammog-raphy (or ultrasound scan if the patient is younger than 35 years). If the assessment is normal, the patient can be reassured as to the benign nature of the condition. Medical treatment may include anti-inflamma-tory agents, contraceptive pill and evening primrose oil.\nMammary duct ectasia is dilatation of the mammary ducts, which become filled with macrophages and chronic inflammatory debris. Patients can present with lumpiness in the breast and chronic inflam-mation, which results in nipple retraction and an eventual slit-like appearance of the nipple that can be confused with DCIS (ductal carci-noma in situ). Acute inflammation can cause abscess formation which discharges at the areolar margin and eventually forms a sinus, acting as a focus for further inflammatory attacks."

She has been feeling generally unwell for the past several days and has 6 weeks previously given birth to a healthy girl, whom she is breastfeeding. On examination, the redness is confined to the left breast and painful to touch. There is no evidence of the nipple being cracked. The patient's general practitioner suspects that she has developed a lactational breast abscess. The most appropriate action would be to\nA. Prescribe an antibacterial agent, e.g. flucloxacillin\nB. Advise the patient to stop breastfeeding and review in 2-3 weeks\nC. Breast aspiration under local anaesthesia\nD. Prescribe an antifungal agent, e.g. ketoconazole\nE.

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Lactational breast abscess formation is most commonly the result of infection with Staphylococcus aureus (a cluster forming Gram-positive organism) during breastfeeding. The organism can enter the breast through a cracked nipple, resulting in increasingly severe pain, mal-aise, fever and lost sleep. Examination will reveal a tender, warm, red segment and occasionally a cracked nipple. Fluctuation occurs only when the abscess is advanced and can cause skin necrosis.\nThe case described is that of acute mastitis, which is initially treated with anti-staphylococcal antibiotics such as flucloxacillin. Breastfeeding does not need to be stopped unless there is obvious damage to the nip-ple, in which case the mother would be advised to express milk from healthy segments on the opposite breast. Continuing pain and loss of sleep, despite treatment with antibiotics, would be an indication of abscess formation that can be aspirated using a wide-bore needle under local anaesthesia. Skin changes such as thinning and areas of necrosis requires drainage of the abscess under general anaesthesia with loculi broken down to prevent recurrence."

            "explanation": "Triple assessment is the mainstay of investigation of breast lumps. It comprises the following:\n• Physical examination\n• Imaging - Ultrasound (women below 35) or mammography (women over 35)\n• Pathology - Fine needle aspiration cytology and/or core biopsy\nThis patient is over the age of 35 and therefore physical examina-tion followed by mammography and fine needle aspiration and core biopsy would have been conducted as part of the triple assessment. Ultrasonography is preferred as an investigation tool in women younger than 35 years as the breast tissue is usually too dense for small lesions to be seen on mammography. In addition, ultrasound is useful for eval-uating palpable lumps."
