            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The falciform ligament does not divide the liver into functional right and left anatomical units. This is done by Cantlie's line (see the following). The falciform ligament extends from the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall and diaphragm on to the anterior and superior surfaces of the liver into the interlobar fissure; it divides the liver anatomically into a large right lobe and much smaller left lobe. The falciform ligament contains the ligamentum teres, which is the obliterated left umbilical vein.\nThe left triangular ligament is a double layer of peritoneum on the superior border of the left lobe of the liver; dividing this ligament allows the lobe to be mobilised from the diaphragm. The right triangular ligament fixes the larger right lobe of the liver to the right hemidiaphragm. To mobilize the right lobe, the right triangular ligament needs to be divided.\nThe main blood supply of the liver is derived from the portal vein, which supplies 80%, the remaining 20% being supplied by the hepatic artery. The right hepatic vein can be exposed outside the liver before it enters the inferior vena cava while the middle and left hepatic veins join the inferior vena cava within the liver. The left extrahepatic duct has a longer intrahepatic course. This important anatomic fact is very useful; because of its accessibility, in high common bile duct strictures, a left hepatico-jejunostomy can be carried out."

            "explanation": "The Scottish anatomist, Sir James Cantlie, in 1897 described a line that divided the liver into two physiological halves indicating the functional midline of the liver. This is 'an extrapolated line from the posthepatic inferior vena cava across the diaphragmatic surface of the liver to the site where the fundus of the gallbladder contacts the inferior margin of the liver'. The French anatomist, Claude Couinaud, in 1957 divided these two halves of the liver into eight segments. Each of these segments are a separate functional unit with a branch of the hepatic artery, portal vein and bile duct and drained by a tributary of the hepatic vein. The physiological and functional right and left halves were thus divided into the following four segments each: segments I–IV in the left half and segments V-VIII in the right half known as the Couinaud's segments (Figure 65.1).\nThe free edge of the lesser omentum between the stomach and liver is thin and fragile, containing the bile duct on the right, hepatic artery medially and portal vein posterior to both. The portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric and splenic veins behind the neck of the pancreas. The inferior mesenteric vein empties into the splenic vein. At the porta hepatis the structures are the portal vein, bile ducts and hepatic artery. The hepatic veins (right, middle and left) enter separately into the inferior vena cava (see previously)."

            "explanation": "The liver has many functions chief among which are maintenance of acid-base balance; metabolism of glucose, fat and carbohydrate; urea formation from protein breakdown; manufacture of bile; maintenance of body temperature; and synthetic functions such as the manufacture of albumin and clotting factors. The normal levels of the transaminases are as follows: AST = 5-40 IU/L, ALT = 5-40 IU/L and GGT = 10-48 IU/L. Increased levels of transaminases (AST, ALT) and GGT indicate acute hepatocellular damage. Raised ALP indicates obstructive jaundice, whilst hyperbilirubinaemia indicates excessive haemoglobin breakdown, liver cell damage, or cholestasis.\nFor jaundice to be clinically obvious the bilirubin level needs to be almost three times the normal. For patients who are being observed for liver damage, the routine tests that are useful are serum bilirubin, albumin and prothrombin time."

            ],
            "explanation": "Ultrasound is the first-line investigation, as it is safe and universally available. It detects liver tumours and biliary pathology. It is operator dependent. CECT is the ‘gold standard' for liver imaging in most clinical situations – trauma, tumour, infections and inflammations. Triple-phase, multi-slice, spiral CECT provides fine detail of liver lesions. Oral contrast shows up the anatomical relationship of the stomach and duodenum to the liver hilum. Intravenous contrast gives the arterial and venous phases. MRI has the following advantages over CECT: there is no risk of allergic reaction as iodine-containing contrast is not used; there is no radiation; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) provides excellent images of the biliary tract; and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) gives high-definition images of hepatic artery and portal vein without recourse to arterial cannulation. As vascular information can be obtained from CECT and MRI, hepatic angiography is mostly reserved when therapeutic embolisation is contemplated, as in trauma or tumour.\nRadioisotope liver scanning does not show anatomical abnormalities but provides diagnostic information and is a useful noninvasive screening test in suspected bile leak or biliary obstruction. HIDA is a technetium-99m radionuclide (⁹⁹Tc Hydroxy Iminodiacetic Acid) administered intravenously for this purpose. A radioactive sulphur colloid liver scan allows the study of Kupffer cell activity; an adenoma or haemangioma can be diagnosed, as these do not take up sulphur colloid because they lack Kupffer cells."

            ],
            "explanation": "Gradual liver failure is associated with high-output cardiac failure with hyperdynamic circulation, collapsing pulse, high systolic and low diastolic pressure (high pulse pressure) and warm extremities. Endotoxins and disordered vasomotor tone have been implicated in causing this cardiovascular problem. In acute liver failure, liver transplantation has poor short-term results.\nThe overall mortality from acute liver failure is about 50% in spite of the best supportive management. Management of acute liver failure should be in the ICU with meticulous fluid balance support, acid-base monitoring, adequate nutrition and organ support such as dialysis and ventilation; reducing cerebral oedema and preventing opportunistic infections are important.\nFlapping tremor is the most obvious clinical sign associated with confusion, memory impairment and personality changes – all features of hepatic encephalopathy brought on by cerebral oedema. The severity of chronic liver disease is graded by the MELD score. This gives the probability of survival based on the patient's international normalised ratio (INR), serum bilirubin and serum creatinine."

            ],
            "explanation": "Liver injuries are rare because of its anatomical position under the diaphragm where it is protected by the lower thoracic cage. Therefore when the liver is damaged, the overall injury is usually very severe. Blunt trauma is often associated with damage to neighbouring structures, such as the spleen, kidneys and mesentery. Stab and gunshot wounds causing penetrating injuries are associated with chest trauma.\nCECT scan is not done in every case of liver trauma. If unstable, the patient needs to be taken to theatre forthwith without wasting time on a scan. On the other hand, stable patients suspected of having liver damage should undergo a CECT scan of chest and abdomen. The stable patient who has no hollow viscus damage, but continues to bleed from the liver, might well benefit from an interventional radiologist who could perform a hepatic angiogram with a view to doing embolisation."

                "E"
            ],
            "explanation": "A penetrating injury, such as a lower right chest and abdominal stab wound, requiring large amounts of blood replacement will need urgent exploration. The patient should be transferred to the operating theatre whilst active resuscitation is underway. Blunt injuries are mostly treated conservatively. Stable patients need to undergo a CECT scan and be treated conservatively as long as they continue to be stable. Exploration for liver injury is ideally carried out by a rooftop incision, which can be extended upward for a median sternotomy (Mercedes-Benz incision) if necessary.\nSevere crush injury is treated by packing and re-exploration after 48 hours. In major liver vascular damage, the patient is put on a venovenous bypass. In this a cannula is passed from the femoral vein to the superior vena cava; this allows the IVC to be safely clamped to facilitate caval or hepatic vein repair.\nIdeally these patients are best managed in a tertiary hepatobiliary unit. In the management of these patients, there should be close liaison with the blood transfusion department, as these patients will not only require large amounts of blood but also fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate. These patients are prone to develop irreversible coagulopathies due to lack of fibrinogen and clotting factors. Standard intraoperative coagulation studies are inadequate and factors are given empirically. An ideal method of monitoring the coagulation status is thromboelastography (TEG), which is a dynamic form of intraoperative assessment of the coagulation profile."

            "explanation": "Acute haematemesis from portal hypertension (Figure 65.2) most often occurs from lower oesophageal varices and not gastric varices. The initial definitive treatment is endoscopic sclerotherapy or banding, the latter having a lesser incidence of oesophageal ulceration. Long-term beta-blocker therapy coupled with endoscopic sclerotherapy or banding is the main treatment for portal hypertension. When this fails, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt (TIPSS) (Figure 65.3) is the treatment of choice in preference to the operation of portocaval anastomosis. Ascites can be treated by insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt – either a Le Veen or Denver shunt. The latter helps to evacuate any debris blocking the shunt.\nIn some instances the rate of blood loss might be so severe that endoscopic evaluation by oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) might not be possible in practice. In such an extreme situation oesophageal tamponade by the use of a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (Figure 65.4) might have to be carried out. The details of its use are in Table 65.1."

            "explanation": "This male patient clinically has the features of a HCC, which is one of the world's most common cancers with the incidence set to rise because of chronic liver disease from hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). He needs to be thoroughly staged with contrast MRI, CECT, bone scan and CT scan of chest including all routine blood tests. The patient is thus assessed regarding his general condition as to his fitness for surgery and severity of the underlying liver disease. The latter is done by the MELD score (see previously) and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) classification. Details of the CTP classification are out of the scope of this book. Once the patient is staged he is discussed in the multidisciplinary team meeting with regard to the best line of management.\nIf surgical treatment is a possibility, the choice is between resection and liver transplantation. The option is tailored according to the stage of liver disease, physical characteristics of the tumour, all facilities available and availability of organ (live or cadaver). Most patients are not amenable for resection because by the time of presentation the disease is beyond surgery. The choices of treatment are shown in Figure 65.5."

            "explanation": "This patient who had a colonic cancer removed 3 years ago now has the following clinical features of secondaries in the liver: jaundice, hepatomegaly and a liver mass on imaging. He needs a thorough reassessment so that he can be considered for hepatic resection. This would consist of oral and intravenous contrast CT of the liver and abdomen, chest CT and colonoscopy to exclude recurrent or synchronous colonic cancer. As the liver secondary is being staged, at the same time the patient's general condition should be assessed with regard to his suitability for a major hepatic resection. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level is useful but has low specificity. Biopsy prior to surgery is not done, as malignant cells can seed along the biopsy track.\nMacroscopically on the surface of the liver secondary a depression is felt, typically described as umbilicated. This is because with time the secondary nodule outgrows its blood supply causing the central core of the secondary to necrose resulting in the surface to collapse (Figure 65.6).\nThe longer the recurrence-free gap between the removal of the primary and appearance of the secondary, the better would be the outcome following resection of the metastasis. This patient's primary was removed 3 years ago. Therefore, he would be a good candidate for resection. As these patients have normal liver parenchyma, they could withstand removal of two-thirds of their liver parenchyma with little risk of postoperative liver failure. The resectability rate of colorectal liver metastasis is 20% to 30% whilst approximately 35% of those resected are alive after 5 years. In a selected group of patients, downstaging the metastasis with chemotherapy have enabled secondaries to be resected, which were considered 'unresectable' in the past."
