            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Its osmolality is almost isotonic with plasma (286 mOsm/kg)\nDextrose/saline is a useful fluid therapy in the early postoperative period because it does not cause salt and water overload and provides some energy to the patient. Dextrose/saline solution, otherwise known as one-fifth normal saline, has an osmolality that is nearly isotonic with plasma because of the 4% content of dextrose. It has a slightly alkaline pH and contains approximately 30 mmol of sodium and chloride ions. It does not contain K+ ions and so potassium supplementation is important if the patient is not yet established on oral intake. It predominantly replaces pure water losses that are common following surgery. It is less useful in hypovolaemic resuscitation as it is a less effective plasma expander than colloid or normal saline and in patients who are losing excess salts."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Two wide-bore cannulae inserted bilaterally to the antecubital fossae\nOptimal fluid volume delivery is through large-bore access achieved with cannulae inserted into the antecubital fossae. Central lines (answers A and C) are generally long conduits with narrow lumens and are therefore less effective at delivering large volumes to hypotensive trauma patients. The same is true of long lines inserted through a femoral approach. It may be necessary to perform a long saphenous venous cut-down, but this approach should be reserved for patients where attempts to obtain standard peripheral venous access have failed."

During resuscitation, the guiding principle is that the best form of fluid therapy is to replace ‘like with like'. Since he is continuing to lose blood, cross-matched blood would be the best form of fluid replacement. The transfusion should be started while arrangements are made for emergency exploration and repair of the injury.\nTwo litres of warmed Hartmann's is the ATLS standard initial resuscitation fluid given as first line therapy for trauma patients. Colloids are useful fluid therapy in hypotensive trauma patients when blood is not immediately available as they expand the intravascular compartment, but they are used following initial crystalloid therapy. Crystalloids rarely induce allergic reactions, although colloids have been known to."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "None of the above\nDespite the question stating that the patient has no overt fluid losses, this patient is likely to have significant covert losses. Patients with small bowel obstruction sequester huge volumes of fluid within their bowel (so called ‘third space losses'). In addition, the fluid lost into the bowel will be salt rich.\nTypical daily requirements for a normal, healthy adult are approximately 1–2.5 L of water, with 1–2 mmol/kg of sodium and 0.5–1 mmol/kg of potassium. The requirements of this patient are far likely to exceed this. In terms of energy requirements in this patient, in the absence of sepsis 30–40 kcal/kg/day should be sufficient. Therefore, none of the options are correct.\nIn patients such as this, the best fluid regimen would be 0.9% normal saline (150 mmol/L Na) with 20–40 mmol potassium chloride added to each litre bag. The rate of fluid therapy should be titrated to vital signs and findings on serial examinations. Additional electrolyte supplementation is often necessary, and this should be guided by serial blood tests."

Ileal fluid contains approximately 130 mmol/L Na+, 110 mmol/L Cl- and 10 mmol/L K+. The most appropriate therapy would be 0.9% normal saline with potassium supplementation. Continuing to push oral fluids is likely to exacerbate losses from a high output ileostomy, worsening dehydration. Five per cent dextrose does not contain the required composition of sodium and chloride ions, and is not preferred in this setting."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Central line insertion\nThis scenario describes a presentation of severe pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is a systemic inflammatory insult; this patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 4 indicating her disease is severe. These patients often present appearing surprisingly well; however, this patient should be expected to deteriorate quickly in the subsequent 24–72 hours. The initial priority in managing acute pancreatitis is fluid resuscitation; losses in pancreatitis are considerable and can be divided into external (vomiting, reduced intake, sweating) and internal. Internal loss is often far greater, comprising pooling within the gastrointestinal tract following ileus and intercellular loss; the ‘cytokine storm' which results from pancreatitis increases the permeability of tissues, particularly in the retroperitoneum and lung parenchyma. This is problematic as these insensible losses cannot be measured or reliably estimated.\nThis patient has evidence of ALI, a complication of systemic inflammation broadly similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The injured lung is increasingly susceptible to fluid overload. In addition, without invasive monitoring, it is impossible to reliably differentiate between the effects of ALI and cardiac failure. This patient requires a central line to guide fluid management as a matter of urgency. A further bolus at this time may further compromise respiratory function and fluid restriction would exacerbate the acute renal injury. There is no evidence that furosemide in these circumstances improves outcome of renal failure; furosemide itself is toxic to the renal system and its administration would only deplete intravascular volume further. This patient needs an echocardiogram, but central monitoring and guided fluid resuscitation takes priority."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This patient has left ventricular failure\nThe placement of a central line was well conceived; a sustained rise in CVP following fluid bolus is indicative of a fluid overloaded system. This patient almost certainly has left ventricular failure and a cause of this should be sought. This scenario is unusual, however; the majority of low blood pressure and oliguria encountered in acute pancreatitis will be due to hypovolaemia; this question is purely designed to assess a candidate's understanding of CVP monitoring.\nThe CVP depends on the venous return to the great veins and the efficiency of the cardiac pump. Increased CVP indicates either an expanded circulating volume or cardiac failure. Causes of non-cardiac pulmonary oedema would not increase the CVP. There is no defined ‘normal range' for CVP and therefore a one-off reading is not useful. A reading before and after a fluid challenge is of more use; if the CVP remains unchanged, then the patient is hypovolaemic. A rise of 2–4 cmH2O which reverses after around 30 minutes indicates the patient is approximately euvolaemic. A sustained rise of >5 cmH2O is indicative of overload or cardiac failure."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Hypocalcaemia may ensue\nMassive blood transfusion is defined as the replacement of an individual's entire circulating volume (>10 units) within 24 hours. Such large transfusions are associated with specific complications, which occur in addition to standard transfusion reactions. These complications occur due to inherent differences between stored blood and blood in circulation.\nStored blood is deficient in platelets and clotting factors (V and VII), the function of which declines rapidly while the blood is in storage. Patients receiving large transfusions should therefore receive additional platelets and cryoprecipitate in order to avoid disseminated intravascular coagulation and transfusion-related haemorrhage. Most centres have their own established massive transfusion protocol. In addition, blood is stored below body temperature, and therefore people receiving large transfusions have commonly become hypothermic.\nElectrolyte disturbance is also common; stored blood has a high potassium content. Post-transfusion potassium overload is a common problem. Transfusion in dialysis dependant renal failure is particularly hazardous. Hypocalcaemia results from the use of the anticoagulant citrate in stored blood. Citrate binds calcium ions and in doing so prevents coagulation. Its anticoagulant effects are reversed when stored blood enters the circulation and the clotting factors are exposed to serum calcium. However, in massive transfusion the citrate load may overwhelm the body's circulating calcium, causing hypocalcaemia."

                "E. Colloid should be changed for blood as soon as is possible"
            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Colloid should be changed for blood as soon as is possible\nThis patient is most likely experiencing reactionary haemorrhage. Therefore, colloid should be changed for blood as soon as is possible. Inevitably, there will be some delay obtaining cross-matched blood so O-negative blood should be obtained if possible. Colloids are often used as a bridge to transfusion while cross-matched blood is prepared. Cross-matched samples should be obtained prior to starting colloids since colloids can interfere with the cross-matching process.\nColloids have high molecular weights and do not readily diffuse across semipermeable membranes. Colloids are therefore thought to be more efficient at expanding the intravascular compartment when compared with crystalloid solutions. One disadvantage is that colloids are more likely to cause allergic/anaphylactic reactions."

It is extremely useful in the replacement of pure plasma losses in trauma and acute haemorrhage and is the first-choice resuscitation fluid according to current ATLS guidance. It contains a lower level of sodium ions than 0.9% normal saline (150 mmol/L) and also a lower level of chloride ions. Its pH is close to that of plasma due to the lactate and bicarbonate ion content.\nHartmann's solution is less useful in the provision of maintenance fluids and electrolytes, particularly when the patient is experiencing excessive salt losses. Unlike normal saline, it is not possible to increase the potassium content of the fluids. Three litres of Hartmann's would only provide 15 mmol/L of potassium; the daily requirement of potassium for an average adult is 0.5–1 mmol/L/kg and therefore 15 mmol/L would not be an adequate maintenance dose for this patient, especially in the presence of small bowel obstruction."

As a general rule, enteral feeding is preferable to TPN in all patients; IV nutrition should be the reserve of patients in whom enteral feeding is impossible or has failed. This is because of the risk of sepsis, thrombus, metabolic imbalance and lipid overload (over 50% of calories in TPN are provided by lipids) as well as the negative effects of prolonged disuse of the alimentary tract.\nNasojejunal feeding has the greatest chance of successfully supplementing nutritional requirements as enteral feeding is delivered beyond the upper small bowel ileus.

            "explanation": "Commence total parenteral nutrition\nProlonged ileus is not uncommon following major abdominal surgery for obstruction. Continuing nasogastric feeding is unlikely to be successful. Nasojejunal feeding is a useful route for ensuring enteral nutrition in patients with upper small bowel ileus in conditions such as acute pancreatitis. However, this patient is an ideal candidate for short-term total parenteral nutrition, which should continue until the ileus resolves, whereupon the patient should be re-established on oral intake. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes are useful in patients who have a functioning gastrointestinal tract, but where oral feeding is considered unsafe or not possible (e.g. patients with swallowing insufficiency following cerebrovascular accident)."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "None of the above\nBlood glucose should be monitored daily as hyper/hypoglycaemia is common on total parenteral nutrition regimens. Electrolyte disturbance is also common and therefore urea, creatinine, potassium, sodium, magnesium and phosphate levels must also be checked daily. Hypophosphataemia is a particular problem with TPN and additional supplementation is almost always required. There is significant risk of sepsis, therefore daily FBC is also required.\nDaily weights should be taken, along with meticulous fluid balance charting. Liver function tests should be performed twice weekly to monitor any sign of cholestatic jaundice and fatty infiltration."

The feed is usually hyper-osmolar, which means that a dedicated large central feeding line is required. Usually, the feed contains 14g of nitrogen as L-amino acids. The lipid content is usually higher than the glucose content, as the latter is converted to CO₂ resulting in more respiratory work for an acutely ill surgical patient."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Central line sepsis\nThis patient is at high risk of central line sepsis. This should be considered as a source in any patient who develops a sepsis with a central venous catheter in situ, especially if there are local signs and symptoms. This risk is far greater in individuals who are receiving TPN through their central line; TPN is the perfect media for bacterial growth. Ideally central lines should be changed every 5 days. If a line is being used for TPN, a dedicated port should be allocated solely for this purpose to minimize risk of colonization. In this case, blood cultures should be sent from both the line and a peripheral site, the line should be removed and the tip sent for microbiological culture.\nAnastomotic leakage should always be considered and excluded, but is less likely in patients who have a stoma and in the absence of peritonism. Basal atelectasis and lower respiratory tract infection commonly complicate major abdominal surgery, especially if abdominal pain limits tidal volume and expectoration, but are decreasingly likely 15 days postoperatively. Urinary tract infection should be excluded, but is unlikely to be the cause in this patient; catheter associated UTIs typically occur within 24–72 hours following removal."
