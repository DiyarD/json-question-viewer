            "explanation": "Epidermal burns include only the epidermis and are classified as superficial burns. Common causes of epidermal burns are sun exposure and minor flash injuries from explosions. Due to the production of inflammatory mediators, hyperaemia occurs; so these burns are red in colour and may be quite painful. The underlying vascular plexus is not affected and hence the capillary refill time is normal. The stratified layers of the epidermis are burnt away and healing occurs by regeneration of the epidermis (also known as epithelialisation) from the underlying intact basal layer."

This can occur when the face or neck are burned, when the fire causing the burn is in an enclosed space, or when hot gases or poisonous vapours are inhaled. Burn injury is more common in the lower airway than in the supraglottic airway. Carbon monoxide has an affinity 240 times greater than oxygen for combining with haemoglobin and thus blocks the transport of oxygen. Blood gas measurement can be done to confirm the diagnosis. A concentration of carbon monoxide above 10% is dangerous; 60% is likely to be lethal. Hydrogen cyanide is a metabolic toxin produced in house fires, which interferes with mitochondrial respiration."

            "explanation": "Carbon monoxide (CO) combines very readily with haemoglobin, forming carboxy-haemoglobin (COHb). Carboxyhaemoglobin dissociates less readily than oxyhaemoglobin, and so once formed reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to tissue anoxia. The dissolved oxygen in the plasma remains unaffected and hence the PaO2 remains normal. In addition to binding preferentially with haemoglobin, CO also binds with great affinity to other haem-containing compounds, most importantly the intracellular cytochrome system. This combination may produce abnormal cellular functioning, and in severe exposure produces a 'sick cell syndrome'. Carboxyhaemoglobin level has to reach about 50% for the patient to manifested symptoms such as hallucination, ataxia, syncope, convulsions and coma; a level of ≥60% could lead to death."

Burn area can be measured by a series of formulae plotted on a chart. It should be remembered that the size of a child's head is proportionally larger than in an adult. The ‘rule of nines' offers only a rough guide to estimate TBSA burn and is not very accurate in children <12 years of age. The Lund and Browder chart is widely used in U.K. burn units and measures a whole arm and hand (both sides) as about 8% of TBSA. In small burns it may be useful to use the patient's whole hand-palm as 1% of TBSA (Figure 30.1)."

If oral fluids are to be used, salt must be added to counter salt loss in the stressed situation. The likely depth of any burn can be derived from the causative agent. Thus fat usually causes deep dermal burns, while full-thickness burns are more certain in electric contact injuries. The burns caused by alkalis such as cement usually produce deep dermal or full-thickness burns. Any burn that heals spontaneously within 3 weeks is superficial; deep dermal burns will take longer. Sensation and capillary filling are features of a superficial burn (Figure 30.2)."

            "explanation": "Virtually every organ system in the body is affected after a significant burn. This is due to alterations in the release of inflammatory mediators and neural stimulation. Immunosuppression is due to depression of many facets of the immune mechanism, both cellular and humoral. Burn injury results in a hypermetabolic state, caused by secretion of the stress hormones, including cortisol, catecholamines and glucagons. In addition, there is suppression of or resistance to anabolic hormones (growth hormone, insulin and anabolic steroids). Blood glucose is often elevated in major burns. Hypovolaemia is a characteristic feature of major burns, which is principally due to loss of protein and fluid into the interstitial space. The lungs frequently suffer from the changes of the post-burn systemic inflammatory response (adult acute respiratory distress syndrome) even in absence of inhalation injury."

A dark, lobster red with slight mottling is indicative of deep partial or full-thickness burn. Hypothermia is a much greater risk in children than in adults. Children under 1 year of age do not have a shivering reflex. Cool water or damp dressing should only be applied to the burn surface, and the rest of the child should be kept warmly wrapped. Continuous assessment (every 30 minutes) until the child reaches the burn unit is essential. A urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hour is adequate in adults; however, in children of this age group, a urine output of at least 1–2 mL/kg/hour is required. Blood lactate level is a useful indicator in the management of burns and rising lactate level associated with a fall in the pH may suggest poor perfusion of the tissue secondary to inadequate intravascular volume."

            "explanation": "All clothing should be removed as soon as possible; any skin that is adherent and peels off with the clothing is 'dead,' and it is essential to remove all dead tissue. Those whose clothing is alight should ‘drop and roll'. The use of a wet blanket may facilitate extinguishing the burning clothing. The burn should be cooled with lukewarm running water for at least 20 minutes. Ice or very cold water should be avoided, as blood flow to the affected area will be reduced. This may lead to hypothermia, which is a particular risk in infants and the elderly. Among others, a full-thickness burn of >5% total body surface area is an indication for transfer to the specialised burn unit. Silver-based products render subsequent assessment difficult and therefore should not be applied without discussion with the burn team. Nasogastric (NG) tubes help to decompress the stomach and are recommended in burn patients, particularly those at risk of aspiration.

            "explanation": "It might be difficult to accurately estimate the total body surface area (TBSA) of burn in an emergency situation. If a quick, initial assessment reveals a partial- or full-thickness burn of ≥15%, fluid resuscitation should be commenced immediately. The resuscitation of burns of >15% TBSA in an adult or 10% TBSA in a child should be monitored by a urinary catheter. Leathery-white or charred-black appearance is suggestive of full-thickness burns. The coagulated tissue is called 'eschar'. It does not blanch with pressure and is typically insensate. Intravenous access should be secured by any means, even through burned skin. Intravenous cut-down in the cubital fossae or on the long saphenous vein may be required if percutaneous intravenous access cannot be obtained. In children <6 years old, if intravenous access is not obtained, access should be sought through an intraosseous approach (commonly in the tibia). Emergency escharotomy may be needed to save life and thus may be indicated before the patient is transferred to the burn unit."

The Parkland formula calculates the fluid to be replaced in the first 24 hours, with half of this volume to be given in the first 8 hours: TBSA percentage × weight (kg) × 4 = volume (mL). For a 70 kg patient with a 16% TBSA burn, the fluids required in the first 24 hours would be about 5040 mL (70 x 18 x 4)."

            "explanation": "Pressure garments may be effective in reducing burn scar hypertrophy but require to be fitted and worn for at least 6 months and would be ineffective if only used for 1 month. Intralesional injection of steroid or application of a silicon patch or sheet might be useful for smaller hypertrophic areas. It is important to treat any itchy areas with appropriate pharmacological agents, as a patient scratching the area may cause distress and increase the chance of introducing infection and delayed healing. The use of Integra may improve the quality of burn scars. Flamazine cream, although useful, should not be used in pregnant women or nursing mothers."

Heart damage is not a feature of low-tension burns but can be in high-tension burns, which are associated with large amounts of subcutaneous and muscle damage, resulting in myoglobinuria and renal damage. Acidosis is more common in large electrical burns and may require treatment with boluses of bicarbonate."

            ],
            "explanation": "The energy imparted from low-voltage electrical injuries usually gives a small entry and exit wound but may cause deep dermal or full-thickness burns. Cardiac damage and myocardial arrhythmias can arise if the alternating current crosses the heart. Cardiac monitoring is indicated if cardiac injury is diagnosed; however, cardiac monitoring is not indicated if the echocardiography is normal and there was no history of loss of consciousness. Acute renal failure can arise from the myoglobin released due to rhabdomyolysis. A urinary catheter should be inserted in all patients with severe electrical burns, once the life-threatening injuries have been addressed and the patient adequately resuscitated. The presence of haemochromogens leads to a dark-coloured urine. Fluid administration should be increased to ensure a urinary output of at least 1–1.5 mL/kg/hour in an adult. If the pigment does not clear with increased fluid administration, 25 g of mannitol should be administered immediately and 12.5 g of mannitol should be added to subsequent litres of fluid to maintain diuresis."

            "explanation": "Chemical burns can be classified broadly into acids, alkalis and other specific agents including petroleum products, nitrates, phosphorous and elemental metals. With phosphorus and elemental sodium burns, washing with copious water is contraindicated. Alkali burns are generally deeper than acid burns and act for a longer time. Acid burns are generally more painful than alkali burns; however, in alkali burns, the onset of pain is delayed, which often postpones first aid and leads to more tissue damage. Radiation burns cause tissue damage associated with blood vessel necrosis – split-skin grafts will not take on avascular tissue, so vascularised flaps or free flap reconstructions are required."

                "B"
            ],
            "explanation": "The local and systemic effects of chemical burns are influenced by the duration of contact, concentration of the chemical and amount of the agent. Both acid and alkali burns should be flushed away immediately with large amounts of water for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Alkali burns require longer irritation than acid burns. If dry powder is still present on the skin, it should be brushed away before irrigation with water. In cement burns, neutralizing agents have no advantage over water lavage, because reaction with the neutralizing agent might itself produce heat and cause further tissue damage. Hydrofluoric acid burns are associated with hypocalcaemia and, following copious lavage with water, treatment with topical calcium gluconate gel (10%) is indicated. Hydrofluoric acid penetrates tissue deeply and even small burns can cause fatal systemic toxicity. Systemic calcium may be required in some patients, as hydrofluoric acid sequesters calcium with the burn."

            ],
            "explanation": "Trench foot or cold immersion foot (or hand) is caused due to a nonfreezing injury of the hands or feet. This is typically seen in soldiers, sailors, or fishermen, who are chronically exposed to wet conditions and temperatures just above freezing, i.e., 1.6°C to 10°C (35°F to 50°F). It occurs due to microvascular endothelial damage, stasis and vascular occlusion. Although the entire foot may appear black, deep tissue destruction may not be present. An alternating arterial vasospasm and vasodilatation occurs, with the affected tissue first cold and anaesthetic, progressing to hyperaemia in 24 to 48 hours. This leads to an intense painful burning and dysaesthesia, as well as tissue damage characterized by oedema, blistering, redness, ecchymosis and ulcerations. Pruritic, red-purple skin lesions (papules, macules, plaques, or nodules) are a feature of chilblain (also known as pernio) and not of trench foot. Complications of trench foot include local infection, cellulitis, lymphagitis and gangrene. Careful protection from further exposure and proper attention to foot hygiene can prevent the occurrence of most such injuries."
