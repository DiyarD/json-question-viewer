Risks can be reduced by avoiding a blunt puncture and taking extra care in difficult cases, such as with those who have had previous operations. Gas dissection within the abdominal wall can be avoided by confirming, without doubt, placement of trocars in the peritoneal cavity before starting insufflation and correlating pressures generated with the volume of gas insufflated. Injury to major vessels is life threatening and should be promptly recognised. Laparotomy performed without delay and expert help, if needed and damage repaired."

Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is used to augment the coagulation effect of the diathermy, but there is a potential for lateral spread and care should be exercised in its use. Biploar energy devices are safer to use. A modern energy device commonly used is ultrasound, which can generate heat and thus must be used with caution."

The advantages are the magnified 3-D vision with articulated instruments, which provide precise dissection. The fixed traction is also of benefit, however, the current robot technology does not allow procedures to be performed in multiple quadrants easily and in dealing with mobile structures."

            "explanation": "Bowel injury is a recognised complication after laparoscopic surgery. This can be due to bowel handling or diathermy injury. Only bowel graspers should be used to handle bowels and all graspers should be kept under vision. This complication is suspected if a patient presents with signs of peritonitis a few days after surgery. Major vessel injury: This is a major life-threatening complication and requires immediate recognition and laparotomy. This complication can be caused by both verres needle and the trocars. Trocars should be inserted cautiously. Port-site bleeding: Port-site bleeding can present with overt wound bleeding or signs of shock due to internal bleeding. The bleeding from epigastric vessels or vessels in the falciform ligament can cause significant bleeding, and this complication can be identified by removing the ports under direct vision. Port-site hernia: Port-site hernia has a 1% to 2% incidence. It is important all the ports of 1 cm and above are closed. Lateral ports made using bladeless trocars are associated with lower incidence of hernia formation. Port-site metastasis: Port-site recurrences are a potential complication following laparoscopic surgery for cancer. In colorectal cancer this is reported as 1%, which is similar to open procedures. This incidence can be reduced by using wound protectors and endobag for specimen retrieval, and by allowing the gas to escape through the ports, avoiding chimney effect, and cleaning the port sites prior to closure. Referred pain: Referred pain to the shoulder is not uncommon after laparoscopic surgery. This is referred from the diaphragm, should subside within a couple of days and can be reduced by ensuring that all the CO₂ is removed from the peritoneal cavity prior to waking the patient up. Sometimes administration of local anaesthetic in the peritoneal cavity can decrease the referred pain. Thromboembolism: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism are potential complications following minimal access abdominal surgery. All patients should receive appropriate DVT prophylaxis based on the current NICE (England) or SIGN (Scotland) guidelines."
