            "explanation": "*   Blunt injuries to the duodenum are uncommon, accounting for approximately 3% to 5% of all intra-abdominal injuries.\n*   The patient's injury, involving 25% of the circumference of the second portion of the duodenum, is classified as a Grade II laceration according to the standardized organ injury scale (Table 1.1).\n*   A Grade II laceration involves disruption by less than 50% of the duodenal circumference.\n*   Retrospective reviews indicate that children with Grade II, III, and IV duodenal injuries managed with primary repair had outcomes comparable to or better than those managed with pyloric exclusion or gastrojejunostomy.\n*   Duodenal diverticulization is a complex, time-consuming procedure that is generally unnecessary.\n*   The triple tube technique of drainage is also unnecessary for a Grade II injury.\n*   Most duodenal injuries, including Grade II, can be primarily repaired after debriding any devitalized tissue.\n*   More complex reconstructions, such as duodenojejunostomy or resection with duodenoduodenostomy, are typically reserved for Grade III or higher injuries.\n*   Lateral tube duodenostomy may be useful for managing leaks after duodenal repair but should not be used as the initial surgical approach.\n*   Pyloric exclusion with associated gastrojejunostomy is generally reserved for patients with duodenal injuries accompanied by a pancreatic injury, as pancreatic fluid can cause breakdown of the duodenal repair."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "*   Fat embolism syndrome (FES) was described over 150 years ago, though its precise etiology remains elusive.\n*   Classic features of FES include young adults (10-40 years), associated long-bone or pelvic fractures, male sex, concomitant pulmonary injury, and delayed fracture stabilization.\n*   Clinical features are often nonspecific and can be indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including hypoxia, respiratory distress, mental status changes, fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, retinal splinter hemorrhages, oliguria/anuria, and occasionally jaundice.\n*   A classic, though inconsistent, finding in FES is a petechial rash over the anterior thorax and axilla, which is typically transient (lasting 24 hours or less). This rash helps differentiate FES from adverse drug reactions, which tend to be more generalized.\n*   Drug-induced thrombocytopenia does not characteristically produce a skin rash.\n*   Two main theories explain FES pathophysiology: the mechanical theory (fat globules obstruct pulmonary capillaries) and the biochemical theory (free fatty acids trigger an inflammatory cascade). Both mechanisms are likely operative.\n*   Treatment for FES is supportive, and the condition is usually self-limited.\n*   Early fracture stabilization is generally accepted as the most effective means of prevention."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "*   Witnessed traumatic arrest should prompt the surgeon to perform a resuscitative left anterolateral thoracotomy.\n*   Thoracotomy allows for evaluation and treatment of intrathoracic injuries, which in this case is likely cardiac tamponade from a penetrating cardiac injury.\n*   The procedure involves incising the pericardium from the apex toward the great vessels, anterior to the left phrenic nerve, to deliver the heart and delineate the injury.\n*   If intrinsic cardiac activity is present, digital occlusion of the injury followed by repair in the operating room is performed. If the heart is asystolic, the cardiac injury is repaired, followed by epinephrine injection and defibrillation.\n*   During pericardotomy, the right hemithorax may be decompressed by creating an aperture through the pericardium, which relieves any right-sided tension pneumothorax.\n*   Although a focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam of the pericardium may reveal hemopericardium, this is only evident if the patient's heart is beating. Delaying intervention to perform a FAST exam is not warranted in this critical scenario.\n*   Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) placement is used for blunt traumatic arrest but does not diagnose or treat cardiac tamponade.\n*   A left tube thoracostomy is not the primary intervention for a patient requiring thoracotomy for direct cardiac access."

            "explanation": "*   Patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and intracranial hemorrhage are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), with an incidence up to 25%.\n*   TBI is an independent risk factor for VTE, and this risk is amplified by mechanical ventilation and other associated injuries.\n*   Chemical prophylaxis reduces the incidence of VTE in multiply injured patients, and guidelines recommend the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) over unfractionated heparin (UFH).\n*   Concerns about worsening intracranial hemorrhage with chemical prophylaxis have been addressed by several retrospective studies and systematic reviews demonstrating its safety. Early chemical prophylaxis, within 24 to 48 hours after injury, did not increase the rate of hemorrhage progression.\n*   Current recommendations suggest sequential compression devices for the initial 24 to 48 hours post-presentation, followed by chemical prophylaxis. Both LMWH and UFH have been studied and are acceptable for chemical prophylaxis in this patient group.\n*   Mechanical prophylaxis (intermittent pneumatic compression) can be used in patients with contraindications for chemical prophylaxis, but chemical prophylaxis provides superior VTE prevention compared to mechanical devices alone.\n*   Aspirin is used as a single agent in orthopedic patients but is not currently recommended for nonorthopedic surgery patients.\n*   Retrievable inferior vena cava filters have been shown in nonrandomized trials to decrease the short-term pulmonary embolus rate but increase the deep vein thrombosis rate, and are associated with insertion complications, inferior vena cava occlusions, and filter migrations. Given these complications, filters are not recommended over chemical prophylaxis.\n*   Routine surveillance venous compression ultrasonography is not recommended as a method of primary prophylaxis, as it did not change pulmonary embolism rates and had false positives in trauma patients."

            "explanation": "*   Causes of traumatic injuries in pregnancy are similar to those in the general population, with blunt trauma being the most common cause.\n*   The primary principle of managing a pregnant patient after injury is to focus on the patient, which yields the best outcomes for both mother and baby.\n*   Splenic injury management includes observation, angioembolization, splenorrhaphy, and splenectomy.\n*   A hemodynamically normal patient with a splenic injury is usually managed nonoperatively with a high success rate.\n*   However, a patient who presents in hypovolemic shock and is not responsive to resuscitation (as indicated by persistent tachycardia despite fluid and blood administration) is at the other end of the spectrum.\n*   Admission hypotension is a strong predictor of the need for splenectomy, and most such patients will require splenectomy.\n*   Angioembolization is suggested as a management option for hemodynamically abnormal patients who respond at least transiently to resuscitation, especially if a contrast blush is present on CT scan (as shown in Figure 13.2).\n*   A splenectomy is recommended for patients who are not candidates for nonoperative management (with or without angioembolization).\n*   In this patient, who is in her first trimester and has a Grade V splenic injury (massive destruction or devascularization, Table 13.3) and is not responding to resuscitation, early splenectomy would quickly and reliably restore normal hemodynamics.\n*   Angioembolization exposes the patient to the risks of radiation to the fetus, complications of the intervention, and recurrent bleeding.\n*   Given the appearance of the spleen on CT scan, splenorrhaphy is unlikely to be possible and would increase the rate of recurrent bleeding compared to splenectomy (3% vs 1%)."

            "explanation": "*   Numerous sites can be used for intraosseous (IO) access, including the anterior tibia, proximal humerus, distal femur, and sternum. The proximal humerus is preferred for mature adolescents and adults.\n*   Crystalloid fluids (e.g., normal saline) for rapid volume expansion and viscous drugs should be administered under pressure to overcome the resistance in the emissary veins and ensure flow to the general circulation.\n*   Pressure devices can include infusion pumps, pressure bags, or manual injection through a syringe and stopcock. With pressure infusion devices, constant evaluation for extravasation is necessary.\n*   The use of warmed crystalloid infusions is imperative for patients in shock, as hypothermia impairs coagulation, causes vasoconstriction, and promotes acidosis, contributing to the \"lethal triad\" (hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy).\n*   Most fluid warmers maintain a set point of 42°C. While fluid may lose some heat in the tubing, it typically enters the body just above normal body temperature.\n*   Temperatures higher than 42°C carry risks of thermal injury.\n*   In this patient with IO access and Class IV shock, a pressure infuser should be used for all fluid administration."

            "explanation": "*   Blunt duodenal injury is uncommon, but when it occurs, duodenal hematomas can obstruct the bowel lumen. These are often seen in children but can also occur in adults.\n*   Management is usually nonoperative because duodenal hematomas typically resolve.\n*   Patients may present with signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction immediately or with delay.\n*   CT scanning of the abdomen in patients with blunt abdominal injury often identifies duodenal abnormalities consistent with a duodenal hematoma, including duodenal wall thickening and paraduodenal edema. Perforation can be excluded if there is no extraluminal air in the pararenal spaces around the duodenum.\n*   Treatment should begin with gastric decompression.\n*   After gastric decompression, a contrast study should be performed to identify the degree of duodenal obstruction.\n*   Parenteral nutrition is required if complete obstruction is present. Enteral nutrition can be attempted if duodenal obstruction is not complete.\n*   Esophagoduodenoscopy is not required, although it might be used to help pass a nasoenteric feeding tube in a patient who is not totally obstructed but cannot tolerate oral feedings. Radiologic placement of a nasoenteric tube is another possibility.\n*   Enteral feeding is preferred over parenteral, but a feeding jejunostomy is not preferred early in management because most patients will not require an operative procedure.\n*   Exploratory laparotomy is not indicated without a trial of nonoperative management. Most duodenal hematomas resolve in 1 to 3 weeks without surgical intervention. If duodenal obstruction persists, then surgical intervention is appropriate. Evacuation of the hematoma is usually not possible, and neither a duodenoduodenostomy nor a jejunoduodenostomy effectively treats the obstruction."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "<b>PROBABLE ANSWER: C<b><br>*   Explosions in civilian settings result in physical trauma from a combination of four distinct mechanisms (Table 25.2).\n*   Primary blast injury results from the impact of the overpressurization wave with body surfaces, primarily affecting gas-filled structures like the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and middle ear. This leads to blast lung (pulmonary barotrauma), which is a pulmonary contusion not associated with rib fractures.\n*   Secondary injury is caused by flying debris (shrapnel).\n*   Tertiary blast injury is blunt force trauma from the body being thrown against objects.\n*   Quaternary blast injuries include burns, crush injuries, and toxic inhalation.\n*   In this case, the explosion was adjacent to the chest wall, and the primary blast injury likely resulted in a pulmonary contusion (Figure 25.3).\n*   Pulmonary contusions take time to develop and may not be evident on initial radiographic imaging.\n*   Being outdoors makes inhalation injury less likely.\n*   The time course of symptoms (cough, oxygen requirement on day 1) would be unusual for pneumonia to develop.\n*   Atelectasis can occur, particularly with associated fractures, but the pulmonary contusion in this case is isolated to the explosion site and lacks the plate-like appearance suggestive of atelectasis.\n*   While a large explosion in a closed space might indirectly force heated gas into distal airways causing thermal burns, this is not the scenario presented."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "*   Central cord syndrome is typically caused by hyperextension of the cervical spine in patients with pre-existing cervical spondylosis.\n*   It involves the upper extremity axons, which are more centrally located within the spinal cord, leading to bilateral loss of sensation and weakness in the upper extremities.\n*   Lower extremity function is usually preserved, and the patient is typically able to walk."
