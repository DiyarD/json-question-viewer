            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Dorsiflexion and plantar flexion occur almost exclusively at the ankle (tibiotalar) joint, while inversion and eversion occur at the subtalar joint. The subtalar joint along with the talonavicular and calcanecuboid joints make up the triple-joint complex. The talus is narrower posteriorly, allowing increased rotatory mobility to the plantar flexed foot. In dorsiflexion, the talus jams tightly in the mortice, externally rotating the fibula and foot. The midfoot has a longitudinal and a transverse arch. The second (not the third) metatarsal head is recessed to act as a keystone to this transverse arch. When the second tarsometatarsal joint is injured (Lisfranc), there is subsequent dysfunction of the transverse arch producing and an acquired flat-foot appearance. The ‘windlass' test consists of asking the patient to stand on tiptoe. This tightens the plantar fascia (not the muscles), and if this and the arch of the foot are intact, the longitudinal arch becomes more pronounced. The blood supply to the foot is from the anterior and posterior tibial arteries and the peroneal artery. The skin on dorsum of the foot is supplied by the superficial peroneal nerve, but the first dorsal web space is supplied by the deep peroneal nerve (Figure 38.1)."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Hallux valgus is characterised by lateral deviation and rotation of the hallux away from the midline, with an associated medial deviation of the first metatarsal. Bilateral involvement is common and more frequently affects women. Risk factors include a genetic predisposition, pes planus, rheumatoid, cerebral palsy, ligamentous laxity and high-heeled or narrow shoes. Patients present with pain, swelling and deformity in the region of the first MTPJ. The hallux might overlap the second and third toes. The medial prominence (bunion) is irritated by footwear creating a red thickened area of skin, a bursa (hypertrophy) and an osteophyte over the underlying bone. Pain can radiate across the metatarsal heads (metatarsalgia) and associated deformities may be found, e.g., hammering of the second toe, callosity over second MTPJ. Radiographs of the feet will help to determine the severity of the deformity, with the common angles measured being the following: • Intermetatarsal angle (normal <9 degrees) • MTP angle (normal <15 degrees) Initially, management is with shoe modification (wide and comfortable shoes) and orthotic insoles when indicated. Surgery is indicated for ongoing symptoms despite conservative measures and is determined by the severity of the deformity. Procedures include first ray metatarsal osteotomy (e.g., Scarf), proximal phalanx osteotomy (e.g., Akin), soft-tissue releases and, in severe cases, joint arthrodesis. Complications include recurrence, AVN and (transfer) metatarsalgia."

Pathological causes for acquired club foot include the following: • Tibialis posterior tendon dysfunction • Hindfoot and tarsometatarsal osteoarthritis Seronegative and inflammatory arthropathy • Charcot neuropathy • Tarsal coalition Post-traumatic, e.g., spring ligament rupture On clinical assessment patients have loss of the normal arch (pes planus), difficulty standing on tiptoes on the affected side, the hindfoot may not pull into varus, i.e., planovalgus deformity and there can be forefoot abduction (too many toes sign). Grading takes into account the degree of deformity and whether it is flexible."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Ankle replacement (Figure 38.2) provides a good outcome in lower-demand patients in whom there is not a severe deformity. Arthrodesis remains the operation of choice for the patient with significant deformity or high-demand patients. In an ankle where a prominent osteophyte can be seen, which is impinging (local anaesthetic injection relieves the pain), osteophyte removal might produce a significant decrease in pain and range of movement. This does not routinely work if there is significant arthritis. It used to be thought that fusion of only one joint in the hindfoot merely produced a rapid deterioration in the other joints. This is now known not to be the case, so single fusion of affected joints is a viable option for a stiff and painful hindfoot. Deformities in the knee produce highly abnormal forces in the foot, which will compromise any attempts to correct any foot pathology. It is therefore generally important to manage problems in the knee before embarking on surgery in the foot."

The bones most frequently affected are calcaneonavicular and subtalar. Clinical assessment could reveal pes planus, hindfoot valgus, forefoot abduction and calf pain secondary to peroneal spasticity. In the first instance, treatment is nonoperative as the majority are found incidentally and asymptomatic. However, if this fails, resection of the coalition or even arthrodesis may be needed."

            "explanation": "Patients with cerebral palsy may toe-walk, partly because they often have a tight tendo Achilles, but also because the loads transmitted through to the tibia help them to stand and walk. Fixed-flexion deformities of both the hip and knee can occur. Problems might be compounded by weak or uncoordinated hip and knee extensors, so standing on tiptoes helps to prevent the knee from collapsing. If the tendo Achilles is lengthened without thinking about this, the child might be able to stand plantigrade but the knee will then collapse. It is therefore important that there is a thorough gait analysis before any surgery is undertaken."

Other potential causes should be considered, e.g., gout, inflammatory arthopathies. Clinical presentation is with progressive pain, swelling and stiffness over the first MTPJ, especially at toe-off. There is a reduced range of movement, particularly in dorsiflexion because of dorsal osteophyte formation. Radiographs confirm the diagnosis. Management can be with modified footwear (stiff-soled, deep toe box), but in a patient with high demands, a MTPJ fusion can be considered. When there are dorsal osteophytes but minimal evidence of arthritis, a dorsal cheilectomy may be beneficial."

            "explanation": "Patients with evidence of pes cavus require a full neurological assessment, with more than 80% of cases associated with a neurological disease. One of the most common causes is Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (HMSN – hereditary motor sensory neuropathy), which is characterised by progressive small muscle wasting of the hands and feet, calf atrophy and classical cavovarus feet. The Coleman block test can be used to determine if the hindfoot deformity is flexible or rigid. Loss of vibration sense and lower limb areflexia might be seen. Other orthopaedic manifestations include developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH) and scoliosis. Diagnosis is with nerve-conduction studies and genetic analysis. Initial treatment is with stretching exercises and orthotics. If the deformity is flexible, soft-tissue releases might correct or slow the progression of the deformity. However, if the deformity is fixed, an osseous correction, e.g., calcaneal osteotomy, or triple arthrodesis can be required. Another cause of pes cavus deformity can be spina bifida occulta. This can leave a bar of bone or scar tissue across the spinal canal that traps the cauda equina as the teenager grows and is called a diastomatomyelia. Release of the bar does not always lead to full recovery."

            "explanation": "This is a compressive neuropathy of the interdigital nerves, which are trapped between the metatarsal heads. It is known as Morton's neuroma and commonly affects females with some suggesting the transverse pressure (repeated micro trauma) from tight shoes to be a predisposing factor. The third and fourth space is most commonly affected, followed by the second or third. Patients complain of pain and paraesthesia in the affected web spaces. On squeezing the metatarsal heads together, pain may be elicited consistent with metatarsalgia, but a click (Mulder's click) might be provoked when it is consistent with a neuroma. Diagnosis is confirmed with ultrasound. Conservative measures are the mainstay of treatment and include modified footwear, orthotics and steroid injections. Surgical excision of the neuroma can be performed, often successfully, if nonoperative measures prove unsuccessful. The symptoms should improve, but the patient will be left with a numb interdigital cleft."

            "explanation": "Diabetic patients are prone to infection due to peripheral vascular disease (poor blood supply and nutrition of tissues), peripheral neuropathy and general immunosuppression. Diabetic ulcers require prompt treatment, as infection can spread to bone. This patient has raised inflammatory markers and radiographic changes consistent with osteomyelitis. Debridement and microbiology-targeted high-dose intravenous antibiotics are required. Gram-positive cocci, e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, are the common causative organisms, although gram-negative organisms and anaerobes are seen with chronic infections. The Charcot joint (neuropathic joint destruction due loss of protective sensation) is seen in diabetic patients. The foot and ankle are commonly affected. The pain is minimal, but the foot or ankle is swollen and radiographs reveal joint destruction out of all proportion to what the minimal pain would suggest. Biopsy and MRI can differentiate a Charcot joint from infection. The three stages are the following: 1 Fragmentation 2 Coalescence 3 Bone consolidation The Charcot foot needs supportive treatment, aiming to prevent deformity and ulceration, e.g., with total contact casting. Arthrodesis provides stability but is not without complication. Amputation can be needed."
