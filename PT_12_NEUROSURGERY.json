            "explanation": "*   The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was developed for initial assessment of head trauma severity and for standardizing serial neurologic examinations in the early postinjury period.\n*   It measures level of consciousness using three parameters: verbal response (5 points), motor response (6 points), and eye opening (4 points).\n*   The score is the sum of the highest number achieved in each category.\n*   A fully oriented and alert patient receives a maximum score of 15.\n*   A score of less than 5 is associated with a mortality of over 50%."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "*   Controlled hyperventilation to a PaCO₂ of 25 kPa raises tissue pH, increases cerebrovascular resistance, decreases cerebral blood flow, and consequently reduces intracerebral pressure (ICP).\n*   Clinicians must be wary of causing ischemic brain damage through hypoperfusion when lowering cerebral blood flow and ICP.\n*   Metabolic compensation to induced hypocapnia leads to normalization of pH by loss of bicarbonate (metabolic acidosis), and the beneficial effects of hypocapnia are lost over 8–24 hours.\n*   Partial pressures of carbon dioxide should be allowed to slowly return to normal and held in reserve for unanticipated ICP increases.\n*   It is important to monitor the patient while PaCO₂ is rising because untoward or rapid increases in ICP may occur in response to rising cerebral blood flow."
