            "question": "A 25-year-old man is blue-lighted into the emergency department following an accident at work. A pan of hot cooking oil had spilled over half of his back and over both his legs and he has sustained extensive burns in this distribution. He weighs 70 kg. Calculate the additional volume of crystalloid this patient will require in the first 8 hours (from the time of his burn) of his treatment using the Parkland formula and the Wallace Rule of Nines.",

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Burn victims lose a lot of fluid following their injury and their treatment is notoriously difficult. The current ATLS guidelines quote the Parkland formula as the preferred method by which fluid replacement should be calculated. The formula is as follows:\n\nWeight (kg) × % Burn × 4 = Volume of crystalloid required over 24 hours\n\nThe percentage burn is best calculated using the Wallace Rule of Nines:\n\n• Head = 9%\n• Arm = 9%\n• Leg = 18%\n• Trunk front = 18%\n• Back = 18%\n\nTherefore, this patient has a percentage burn of 45%. Using this percentage in the formula gives a volume of 12,600 ml. Half of this should be given in the first 8 hours, the rest over the subsequent 16 hours. Obviously this is a rough guide and local practice will differ. All patients with this extent of injury should be managed in a specialist centre, typically in an intensive care unit. The take home message is that large volumes of fluid are required."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "This patient has sustained severe injuries and has developed an advanced degree of haemorrhagic shock. Circulatory support is paramount and therefore central line insertion is justifiable. Intubation may not be urgently required; however, his low GCS at presentation identifies him as a patient at risk of further deterioration, and intubation in these cases certainly is not contraindicated. Severely traumatized patients can develop gastric distension and with an obtunded conscious state they are at risk of aspiration, therefore NG tube insertion is advocated. Helmet removal is not recommended at the scene of injury; however removal in the emergency department is advised to allow appropriate assessment and airway protection.\n\nUrinary catheterization is desirable in shock patients to guide fluid management. However, any suspicion of urethral disruption is an absolute contraindication for urethral catheter insertion. You should have a high index of suspicion in the following circumstances:\n\n• Blood at the penile meatus\n• Perineal bruising\n• Blood in the scrotum\n• High-riding prostate\n• Pelvic fracture\n\nConformation of the integrity of the urinary tract is required by retrograde urethrogram prior to catheter insertion. If urethral injury is confirmed, suprapubic catheterization is indicated."

            "explanation": "The ATLS guidelines teach a method of rapid assessment of the traumatized patient divided into a primary survey, which is aimed at the identification of immediate threats to life, and a secondary survey, which aims to identify more minor injuries. Thoracic injuries which are an immediate threat to life include flail chest, tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive haemothorax and cardiac tamponade. Pulmonary contusion is not an immediate threat to life, and therefore is not of initial concern during the primary survey. However, it can complicate recovery as the injured lung can impair gas exchange and may be more susceptible to fluid overload."

Another factor is poor peripheral perfusion; an oximetry trace which is low compared with the values gained from arterial blood gas sampling indicates that the patient is peripherally shut down, a consequence of low circulating volume and shock. Pulse oximetry gives no indication of pO2, pCO2, blood pressure or acid-base balance."

A laryngeal mask airway has an inflatable cuff, but this sits on top of the larynx and does not intubate the trachea. It therefore provides no airway protection from aspiration or laryngeal oedema."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "This patient has sustained a significant head injury which complicates your choice of airway. Candidates should be aware that any suspicion of a basal skull fracture is an absolute contraindication to nasopharyngeal airway and nasogastric tube insertion. This is because of the risk of penetrating through the damaged cribriform plate and intubating the brain.\n\nThe signs suggestive of basal skull fracture include periorbital ecchymosis (panda eyes/raccoon eyes), retroauricular ecchymosis (battle sign), CSF leakage from the nose or ears and VII/VIII cranial nerve dysfunction. The internal carotid artery may also be injured resulting in dissection or pseudoaneurysm. CSF leakage can be differentiated from blood by dripping the fluid on a white sheet; CSF will form concentric circles whereas blood will simply make a spot.\n\nWith nasopharyngeal tube placement contraindicated, the first option in this patient would be Guedel oropharyngeal airway placement. A patient with a GCS score of 8 may still gag on the Guedel airway, although with a patient thus obtunded, it is possible it will be tolerated without sedation. An endotracheal tube may well be required later in the resuscitation because this patient has a severe head injury; however, endotracheal intubation requires an anaesthetist and significant time. Guedel airway placement should still be considered the first choice adjunct as it is quick, allowing further assessment of the patient to continue, and it acts as a bridge to intubation."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Circulating volume accounts for approximately 7% of body mass. Therefore, a 70 kg adult has a circulating volume of 5 L. This rough guide is less reliable in children, in whom the circulating volume accounts for 8%-9% of body mass, or in obese people, in whom calculation should be based on their ideal body weight to avoid gross overestimation of blood loss.\n\nOnce the total volume has been calculated, estimate blood loss by assessing the class of shock. Class I shock (see Question 8) corresponds to a blood loss of up to 15% (750 mL in a 70 kg man). Class II shock equates to 15%-30% blood loss (750-1500 mL) and class III to 30%-40% (1500-2000 mL). Class IV shock accounts for blood loss of over 40%. Therefore, in this scenario, with the patient in class II shock, the best answer would be B (1000 mL blood loss)."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Flow rates through a hollow tube are dependent on two factors: the radius and the length of the tube. Poiseuille's law states that flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the radius of the cannula and inversely proportional to the length. Therefore the most effective way of giving fluids is through a short fat peripheral cannula, and not, as commonly believed, through a central line. Other factors affecting flow rate include the viscosity of the fluid and the pressure difference across the tube.\n\n• Brown/orange (14 G) cannula – may deliver 250 mL/min\n• Grey (16 G) cannula – 170 mL/min\n• Green (18 G) cannula – 90 mL/min\n• Pink (20 G) cannula – 55 mL/min\n• Blue (22 G) cannula – 25 mL/min"

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Beck's triad consists of venous pressure elevation, reduced arterial blood pressure and muffled heart sounds. These three features are the classic identifying features of cardiac tamponade. In addition, an exaggerated pulsus paradoxus (a fall in arterial blood pressure >10 mmHg on spontaneous inspiration) and Kussmaul's sign (rising venous pressure on spontaneous inspiration) are also signs of tamponade. Knowing this, candidates can correctly identify tamponade as the likely diagnosis in this scenario.\n\nThe next thing to recognize is that this patient is peri-mortem. There are two methods used to confirm the diagnosis of tamponade: echocardiography in the form of a FAST (a focused assessment with sonography for trauma) scanner is less invasive, but has a false negative rate of 10% even in experienced hands. In a patient as compromised as the scenario suggests, with a convincing history of penetrating chest injury, pericardiocentesis is both diagnostic and therapeutic, and should not be delayed by other diagnostic adjuncts. Resuscitative thoracotomy may be required, but is the reserve of surgeons experienced enough to perform such a procedure. Pericardiocentesis should be attempted first to allow time for a more controlled surgical management. Thoracotomy or a pericardial window procedure should be reserved for cases where pericardiocentesis fails."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Flail chest is a term used to describe an injury to the chest wall which results in a section losing continuity with the remainder. This loose segment is therefore sucked in by the negative pressures implicit in inspiration, preventing effective respiration and causing significant damage to the underlying lung parenchyma. These two factors combined result in significant impairment of gas exchange and respiratory failure.\n\nAnalgesia will improve the patient's pain but since the respiratory failure is not due to pain restricting breathing it will not save this patient's life. Fluid resuscitation is a complicated issue in these patients; a careful balance must be struck as the injured lung is vulnerable to fluid overload, which only exacerbates the poor gas exchange. High-flow oxygen will partially reverse the hypoxia, but is only a holding measure and will not affect the carbon dioxide retention. This patient requires mechanical ventilation and therefore the placement of a definitive airway. Both endotracheal intubation and cricothyroidotomy will provide this, but surgical airways are reserved for cases in which intubation fails or is impossible due to severe facial injury. Therefore, endotracheal intubation is the best option in this case."

The point of disruption in the wall of the aorta is at the ligamentum arteriosum, across which the aorta may kink or twist, causing dissection or rupture.\n\nRupture into the left side of the chest is nearly universally fatal, unless it occurs in the emergency department itself. In those who survive, the haematoma is retained either within the adventitia or within the mediastinum. Features on a chest radiograph include the following:\n\n• Widening of the mediastinum\n• Loss of the aortic knuckle\n• Deviation of the trachea to the right\n• Obliteration of the space between the aorta and pulmonary artery (the AP window)\n• Depression of the left main bronchus\n• Left-sided haemothorax\n\nIt is rare for there to be no signs evident on plain radiographs following great vessel disruption; however, it can occur in in 1%-2% of cases."

Like all abscesses and collections, there is little scope for conservative therapy, and empyema requires invasive drainage. The fluid collection is typically thick and loculated, making needle aspiration an inappropriate method of therapy. Definitive management is with chest drain re-insertion; however, this should be guided by appropriate imaging. Computed tomography may be helpful; however, ultrasound is perfectly adequate in assessing loculations and can also be used to guide drain insertion. As it does not involve exposure to ionising radiation, ultrasound should be the first choice technique."

A litre of Hartmann's solution is instilled into the peritoneal cavity through a catheter and then drained. The fluid is sent to the laboratory, examined for blood and food fibre and Gram stained for bacteria.\n\nAlthough non-specific, it is 98% sensitive, making it more reliable than CT and FAST scanning. In addition, it is able to identify hollow organ injury more reliably in the immediate post-injury setting than CT or ultrasound. However the use of DPL is declining in favour of the less invasive techniques and because the procedure requires insertion of a catheter into the peritoneal cavity decompression of the bladder and stomach is required to minimize risk of injury to these organs. The disadvantage of DPL is that it is unable to identify retroperitoneal injury i.e. damage to the kidneys, ureters, duodenum and pancreas. Therefore option A is the correct answer in this case."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Although opinions among trauma surgeons vary, studies show that 33% of anterior abdominal stab wounds fail to penetrate the peritoneum and only 30% of stabbing injuries cause visceral injuries. Therefore, the current ATLS guidance does not advocate explorative laparotomy in all such cases. A haemodynamically stable patient with no evidence of peritonism may be managed conservatively with regular observations and serial clinical examinations over a 24-hour period. Where doubt remains, local exploration of the wound under local anaesthesia may clarify the extent of the injury. Other options include DPL and diagnostic laparoscopy.\n\nA laparotomy is automatically indicated if evisceration of bowel or omentum occurs following penetrating injury or if the patient is haemodynamically unstable or has peritonism. In addition, if penetration of the peritoneum is confirmed, the majority of trauma surgeons advocate explorative laparotomy in the absence of clinical evidence of haemodynamic instability or peritonitis. In contrast to stab wounds, gunshots to the abdomen carry a 90% risk of visceral injury, and therefore all such patients are candidates for laparotomy. Blunt trauma carries a risk of diaphragmatic injury as well as injury to solid and hollow viscus. Hypotension, peritonism or free air or fluid evident on abdominal radiographs or an erect chest radiograph following blunt abdominal trauma are all indications for surgical exploration."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Splenic injury is the most common organ injury sustained as a consequence of blunt trauma to the abdomen. Complications in trauma patients who require splenectomy are significantly greater than in similar patients who do not require splenectomy; causes of death include sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. All splenic injury patients should receive vaccines against pneumococcus and meningococcus immediately, regardless of the extent of injury.\n\nIn modern surgical care, every effort is made to retain the spleen. Haemodynamically, stable patients require investigation utilizing both ultrasound and CT scanning. Injury is graded 1-4, according to the extent of the capsule laceration and involvement of the hilum. Grades 1-3 are widely considered to be suitable for conservative therapy. Grade 4 injuries extend into the hilum; as such they are at greater risk of major haemorrhage and devascularisation of the spleen. Significant controversy has existed regarding the management of this group of patients, although evidence suggests surgery can be safely avoided in haemodynamically stable patients using conservative measures. Splenic artery embolization using interventional radiographic techniques can be used if bleeding should continue in such cases.\n\nIn patients being managed conservatively, close monitoring is required in a high-dependency setting as a minimum. There is a risk of major haemorrhage and serial examination supplemented with regular CT scanning should be implemented. Patients should, of course, be cross-matched according to the centre's major bleeding protocol. Clinicians must be aware that in 5% of cases of presumed isolated solid organ injury, there exists an unrecognized concomitant hollow viscus injury. Deterioration, peritonism or haemodynamic compromise indicates the need for laparotomy, but in the case described above this is not yet required."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "FAST is a non-invasive technique that can be performed in the emergency department, advantages which mean it is increasingly preferred to DPL and CT scanning in the assessment of the traumatized abdomen. In experienced hands, this technique is equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to DPL and CT; however as with all ultrasound scanning techniques this is operator-dependent and an experienced individual is required.\n\nFour views are taken:\n\n• The pericardium and the three sites within the abdomen where free fluid most commonly collects:\n• Hepatorenal fossa\n• Splenorenal fossa\n• Pouch of Douglas\n\nScanning is difficult to achieve in obese patients and subcutaneous free air makes ultrasound imagery impossible, as air does not transmit sound waves to deeper tissues. Previous surgery distorts normal anatomy and increases the likelihood of adhesions which prevent the free movement of blood within the peritoneal space and therefore its collection in the normal areas. This has a predictable effect on the sensitivity of FAST scanning.\n\nThe primary aim of FAST scanning is not to achieve a diagnosis, but to confirm the presence of peritoneal free fluid. Therefore a large-volume haematoperitoneum will be easier to detect on FAST scanning, although finding its source might not be. Therefore, option E is the most appropriate answer in this case."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "Haemorrhage within the cranial vault is commonly classified according to the layer of meninges in which the bleeding collects. The three layers of membranes which make up the meninges are the tough fibrous dura, the arachnoid and the pia mater. The dura is firmly adherent to the undersurface of the skull; within the folds of dura run the venous sinuses which drain to the internal jugular veins. Between the dura and the skull run the meningeal arteries, whose branches penetrate the dura to supply the brain substance. The arachnoid lies beneath the dura but does not adhere to it which leaves a potential space, the subdural space, for blood to collect (see Question 22). Between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater flows the CSF. Bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes signs of meningism and puts the patient at increased risk of hydrocephalus, because blood may occlude the arachnoid granulations and prevent CSF reabsorption (post-traumatic communicating hydrocephalus).\n\nThis case is a classic description of extradural haemorrhage; bleeding is most commonly, but not exclusively, from a meningeal artery. The most commonly involved vessel is the middle meningeal artery, as it underlies the weakest point in the cranial vault, the temporal bones. Although the temporal bone is protected somewhat by the temporalis muscle, a blow to the side of the head may cause a fracture, with consequential rupture of the underlying vessel. Because the dura is adherent to the bone, blood spread is restricted and therefore collects in a lens shape. In subdural and subarachnoid haemorrhage the blood is free to spread out over the surface of an entire cerebral hemisphere due to the lack of membrane adherence to overlying or underlying structures."

Veins, with their thinner walls, are more susceptible to such damage and therefore the vast majority of subdural haematomas are venous. They occur more commonly than other forms of intracranial haemorrhage, complicating approximately 30% of severe head injuries.\n\nFactors which predispose to subdural haemorrhage include all causes of cerebral atrophy, namely old age, alcohol, dementia and schizophrenia.

            "explanation": "Injury to the head following trauma can be divided into primary (i.e. damage sustained as a direct result of the injury itself) and secondary. Minimization of secondary brain injury should be the main aim of management of the injured patient and maintenance of cerebral perfusion is paramount. Patients usually require ventilation and should be managed on ITU/HDU and kept normotensive with a normal pO2 and pCO2.\n\nThis management is complicated by the presence of increased ICP. Mechanical hyperventilation has been used extensively as a technique to effectively reduce ICP; the resulting hypocapnia results in cerebral vasoconstriction and therefore reduced CSF and vascular volume within the cranial vault. However, vasoconstriction results in hypoxic brain injury, so prolonged hyperventilation must be discouraged and, ideally, pCO2 should be maintained above 4.5 kPa. In the normotensive patient, diuretics such as mannitol with or without furosemide may be used to reduce ICP. These agents can cause hypotension, which should be avoided, and therefore they are not used in patients with low blood pressure. When raised ICP proves refractory to other measures, barbiturates can be used, but are associated with a high risk of inducing hypotension and are therefore avoided in the acute resuscitative phase. Steroids have been shown to have no effect on ICP and no beneficial effect on short-term or long-term outcome following brain injury; therefore their use is in decline and is not advocated in current guidelines."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This patient presented with a moderate brain injury. Up to 20% of such patients can be expected to deteriorate or become comatose. The first thing to consider is an expansion of an intracranial haemorrhage with subsequent raised ICP. The Monro-Kellie concept is useful in explaining why intracranial bleeding may initially be compensated for but, once the threshold for compensation is exceeded, eventually results in rapid decompensation unless intervention supervenes. The cranial vault has a fixed volume; bleeding within the skull has a mass effect and therefore some of the existing volume must be sacrificed. This is initially possible since venous volume and CSF volume can be lost, hence the initial period of compensation. However, once haematoma volume exceeds approximately 150 mL, the ability for the venous and CSF compartments to compensate is overwhelmed and ICP rises exponentially with further added volume. With increased ICP, arterial flow is compromised and brain matter is under pressure, leading to herniation.\n\nMost commonly, the result is uncal herniation; the uncus is the medial part of the temporal lobe, which may be pushed against the edge of the tentorial notch. This puts pressure on the III cranial nerve, which runs along the edge of the tentorial notch, resulting first in loss of parasympathetic supply, then complete oculomotor palsy. The motor tracts are also vulnerable, positioned superficially at that level of the midbrain. Therefore the typical signs of uncal herniation include ipsilateral parasympathetic + motor oculomotor nerve palsy with motor weakness. Confusion can arise when considering the motor signs of uncal herniation; hemiparesis can be contralateral or ipsilateral (Kernohan's phenomenon) to the lesion depending on the severity of herniation. Therefore, all head injury patients with altered consciousness, third nerve and motor signs should be referred for immediate emergency neurosurgical consultation."

            "explanation": "Cervical spine support is of primary importance when managing a trauma patient. Because of this the vast majority of accident victims will be brought to the emergency department with a collar in place, and candidates will need to know when it can be removed, and when they must not do so. It is acceptable to clear a cervical spine on clinical grounds when a patient is fully awake, sober, alert and neurologically intact with no neck pain. If the patient complains of neck pain, or if their consciousness is impaired, it is obligatory to perform plain fılm examination as a minimum. If the patient does not complain of neck pain, but has a distracting injury, such as in this case, cervical spine films may be taken despite a normal level of consciousness.\n\nFor plain films to be adequate, both AP and lateral views of the entire cervical spine should be taken, inclusive of the base of the skull and T1 vertebrae. In addition a view through the mouth visualizing the C1 and C2 vertebrae (also called a ‘peg view') is required. Failure to meet these requirements, or identification of areas of suspicion, indicates the need for CT scanning. Flexion-extension films should only be attempted in patients who are fully conscious with normal AP, lateral and peg views; they are used to identify areas of occult instability. They are contraindicated in patients with an altered level of consciousness.\n\nLeaving a patient on a backboard for over 2 hours puts them at risk of development of decubitus pressure ulceration. The risk is particularly high in patients with a reduced level of consciousness, therefore clearance of the cervical spine and avoidance of unnecessary immobilization is advisable."

            "explanation": "Carbon monoxide poisoning is a common consequence of being trapped in an enclosed space during a fire. It should be considered in all patients with such a history as it is easily treated and failure to do so may have serious consequences. However, if confusion continues despite appropriate treatment, or if there is evidence of head injury or focal neurology, further investigation such as CT scanning may be warranted.\n\nCarbon monoxide's affinity for haemoglobin is 240 times that of oxygen. Its half-life is 4 hours while a patient breathes room air; this is reduced to 40 minutes if appropriate oxygen therapy is instituted. Symptoms depend on the percentage haemoglobin saturation by carbon monoxide; saturations less than 20% are typically asymptomatic, 20%-40% saturation causes nausea, headache and confusion. Saturations of 40%-60% result in coma and death occurs once levels exceed 60%. Appropriate management is high-flow oxygen via a non-rebreathing mask. Intubation and ventilation is only rarely required.\n\nBecause of its high affinity for haemoglobin, carbon monoxide saturates haemoglobin at low partial pressures; therefore normal arterial pO2 does not exclude a high carbon monoxide saturation. Pulse oximetry does not differentiate between haemoglobin saturated with oxygen and that saturated with carbon monoxide, and therefore saturations will appear normal. Carboxyhaemoglobin levels are used to confirm the diagnosis; some arterial blood gas machines are able to provide these measurements."

            "explanation": "Skin is inherently elastic and allows expansion and relaxation of underlying tissues. When skin is lost due to burns or other causes, fibrotic scarring occurs. When such injuries are circumferential, as in this case, healing can constrict underlying tissues, blood vessels and nerves. Limbs are vulnerable, as is the neck and even the chest, where extensive injury can restrict chest expansion and impair breathing.\n\nThe patient in this case is clearly exhibiting the signs of muscle compartment compromise secondary to restricted blood supply. There is concomitant paraesthesia, which may be as a result of ischaemia or a direct result of nerve compression. Fluid resuscitation is not required and although an electrolyte imbalance should be ruled out it is unlikely to be causative. Angiography is not indicated. This patient requires urgent escharotomy (incision of scar tissue to release constricting pressure). Fasciotomy is rarely required in such cases, but may be indicated if vascular supply remains compromised for a prolonged period and true compartment syndrome develops."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Hypothermia is classified into mild (35-32°C), moderate (32–30°C) and severe (less than 30°C). The clinical manifestations of hypothermia include decreased consciousness, decreased respiratory rate and decreased heart rate. Cardiac output also falls proportional to the severity of hypothermia, and a patient who initially lacks any signs of life may make a full recovery with appropriate supportive therapy.\n\nThe main cause of death is cardiac arrhythmia; the myocardium becomes increasingly irritable below a temperature of 33°C and patients are at particular risk of fibrillation. Because of this, all hypothermia patients require cardiac monitoring and should be rewarmed using ‘passive external warming techniques' including blankets, external heat sources and warmed IV fluids. The possibility of confounding causes of unresponsiveness should not be overlooked, and evidence of alcohol, drug use or sepsis should be excluded. Hypoglycaemia is another cause of reduced responsiveness that also frequently occurs secondary to hypothermia; therefore blood glucose monitoring and IV dextrose should be initiated as standard.\n\n‘Active core rewarming methods' are the reserve of severe hypothermia or hypothermia in high-risk patients (i.e. in conjunction with other injuries) and would not therefore be indicated in this scenario. Such techniques include warmed peritoneal lavage, warmed pleural lavage, warmed bladder irrigation, arterio-venous rewarming and cardiopulmonary bypass."
