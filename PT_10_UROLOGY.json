            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Patients who have a lower motor neuron lesion (flaccid neurogenic bladder) can usually be managed by conservative measures that prevent the development of a large residual urine volume in the bladder.\n- These measures include intermittent self-catheterization and scheduled voiding with increased abdominal pressure provided by the Valsalva maneuver or manual pressure on the abdomen.\n- Detrusor contractions can sometimes be strengthened by parasympathomimetic agents such as bethanechol chloride (Urecholine).\n- Bladder augmentation to increase capacitance, bladder neck resection to reduce outlet obstruction, and supravesicle ureteral diversion are indicated only in the presence of deterioration of bladder compliance or gross ureterocalyxectasis that resists the foregoing measures and threatens the loss of renal function or debilitating urinary incontinence.\n- Severely restricting fluid intake is impractical and may promote formation of calculi."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Hypospadias is a common congenital anomaly of the penis resulting from incomplete development of the anterior urethra.\n- It occurs in about 1 in 300 live births and is believed to have a multifactorial genetic mode of inheritance.\n- Of those with hypospadias, about 7% have a father with the disorder, 14% a brother, and 20% a second family member.\n- Hypospadias occurs in the corona in about 75% of cases, where it is often accompanied by chordee.\n- Undescended testes occur in about 10% of cases of hypospadias, as do inguinal hernias.\n- Hypospadias in the scrotal area is associated with bilateral undescended testes and infertility and must be differentiated from pseudohermaphroditism and adrenogenital syndrome."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Initial management should include hydration and analgesics.\n- However, as the stone is larger than 1 cm, it is unlikely to pass spontaneously, though stones smaller than 0.5 cm usually do pass spontaneously.\n- The size of the stone also makes a high-grade obstruction more likely; therefore an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) must be urgently performed.\n- A high-grade obstruction will require nephrostomy or the passage of a ureteral stent.\n- If the stone is completely occluding the lumen of the ureter, the urinalysis may not show microhematuria and thus may be misleading.\n- Approximately 15% of patients will have a recurrence within 1 year, and almost 50% may have a recurrence within 4 years.\n- Elevated BUN and creatinine are expected only in the setting of an obstructed single functioning kidney."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- By the second year, a testicle not in the cooler environment of the scrotal sac will begin to undergo histologic changes characterized by reduced spermatogonia.\n- Testicles left longer in the undescended state not only have a higher incidence of malignant degeneration, but are inaccessible for examination.\n- If a malignancy should occur, diagnosis will be delayed.\n- There is also a substantial psychological burden when children reach school age or are otherwise subjected to exposure of their deformed genitalia.\n- Gel-filled prostheses are generally inserted when a testicle cannot be placed in the scrotum.\n- Close follow-up by a physician until the late teens is indicated in all patients who have had an undescended testicle.\n- Since these patients may be at increased risk for malignancy throughout life, careful training should be given in self-examination."

            ],
            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Seminomas tend to grow slowly and metastasize late.\n- They usually present as a nonpainful lump that does not transilluminate.\n- They represent about 40% of malignant testicular tumors; embryonal cell carcinoma and teratocarcinoma each represent about 25%.\n- Because most tumors have mixed elements, they are usually classified according to the most malignant cell type encountered, whatever the predominant cell type.\n- When metastases occur, they are usually along the regional lymphatic drainage pathways to the iliac, aortic, and renal lymph nodes.\n- Because of their slow growth and radiosensitivity, seminomas are associated with a 90% 5-year survival rate.\n- Therapy generally consists of removing the affected testis and sampling the lymph nodes (usually external iliac) for evidence of metastasis.\n- If metastases are present, radiation therapy is given locally to areas of known involvement.\n- Radiation therapy is highly effective in seminoma, and metastatic disease may be palliated for extended periods."

                "e. The differential diagnosis includes spermatocele"
            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Testicular torsion occurs commonly in adolescents.\n- The underlying pathology is secondary to an abnormally narrowed testicular mesentery with tunica vaginalis surrounding the testis and epididymis in a \"bell-clapper\" deformity.\n- As the testis twists, it comes to lie in a higher position within the scrotum.\n- Urinalysis is usually negative.\n- Elevation will not provide a decrease in pain (negative Prehn sign); a positive Prehn sign might indicate epididymitis.\n- A 99mTc pertechnetate scan may be helpful in clarifying a confusing case; however, operation should not be delayed beyond 4 h from the time of onset of symptoms in order to maximize testicular salvage.\n- This patient's presentation warrants immediate operation.\n- The salvage rate for delay greater than 12 h is less than 20%.\n- Both the affected and unaffected testes should undergo orchiopexy.\n- The differential diagnosis between torsion of the testicle and epididymitis is sometimes quite difficult.\n- On occasion, one has to explore a patient with epididymitis just to rule out a torsion of the testicle.\n- Epididymitis usually occurs in sexually active males.\n- Urinalysis is usually positive for inflammatory cells, and urethral discharge is often present.\n- Spermatocele is a cyst of an efferent ductule of the rete testis.\n- It presents as a painless transilluminable cystic mass that is separate from the testes."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "- Genitourinary tuberculosis develops from reactivation of foci in the renal cortex or prostate that were hematogenously seeded during the primary (usually asymptomatic) pulmonary infection.\n- Local spread from the renal and prostatic sites can lead to involvement of the calyx, ureter, bladder, vas deferens, epididymis, and (rarely) the testis.\n- A low-grade inflammatory response results in hematuria or pyuria without bacteriuria.\n- Whenever pus cells are seen on routine urine culture without bacteria on smear or culture plate, genitourinary tuberculosis should be considered.\n- The end result of focal caseation necrosis in the kidney may be scarring and dystrophic calcification.\n- Genital tract infection often causes an asymptomatic swelling in the epididymis; secondary infection or formation of a sinus tract to the scrotal skin may cause more dramatic signs and symptoms.\n- Epididymal tuberculosis is usually managed by chemotherapy, with surgery reserved for refractory cases.\n- Pneumaturia is associated with a colovesical fistula and not with genitourinary tuberculosis."

            "explanation": "- One of the most frequent causes of male cancer deaths, prostate cancer has an incidence of more than 75,000 new cases per year in the United States.\n- American blacks appear to have a 50% higher incidence and mortality.\n- Prostate cancer (adenocarcinoma) arises initially in the periphery of the gland.\n- Therefore, one of the best screening tests is careful rectal examination.\n- However, the use of screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has increased the detection rate fourfold.\n- Spread is by direct local extension and by lymphatic and vascular channels.\n- The most common locations of distant metastases are in the axial skeleton with osteoblastic bony lesions.\n- A single focus of disease discovered on TURP or simple prostatectomy is considered stage A₁.\n- Only 2% of patients have unsuspected nodes (i.e., only 2% 5- to 10-year mortality).\n- Therefore, no definitive therapy is required except possibly in patients less than 60 years old.\n- Follow-up should be undertaken and progression of disease may be treated as necessary.\n- Several foci or diffuse disease is considered stage A2 and surgery or radiation therapy is generally indicated."

            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- In contrast to prostate cancer, BPH arises first in the periurethral prostate tissue as a fibrostromal proliferation.\n- As the periurethral prostate grows, the outer prostate glands are compressed against the true prostatic capsule, which results in a thick pseudocapsule.\n- As the prostate enlarges, it encroaches on the urethra and causes urinary outflow obstruction.\n- Obstructive symptoms include decreased force of stream, hesitancy, recurrent UTIs, and occasionally acute urinary retention; the latter two are indications for surgery.\n- Uroflow is the best noninvasive method of estimating the degree of outlet obstruction.\n- Flow less than 10 mL/s is good evidence of significant obstruction.\n- The major treatments for BPH are surgical.\n- Simple prostatectomy involves shelling out the prostate adenoma and leaving the pseudocapsule (true prostate) behind.\n- Therefore, these patients are still at risk of developing prostate cancer although BPH in and of itself is not a risk factor for prostatic cancer."

            "explanation": "- If time and the patient's condition permit, primary ureteral reconstruction should be carried out.\n- In the middle third of the ureter, this will usually consist of ureteroureterostomy using absorbable sutures over a stent.\n- If the injury involves the upper third, ureteropyeloplasty may be necessary.\n- In the lower third, ureteral implantation into the bladder using a tunneling technique is preferred.\n- If time does not permit definitive repair, suction drainage adjacent to the injured segment alone is inadequate; either ligation and nephrostomy or placement of a catheter into the proximal ureter is an acceptable alternative that would allow reconstruction to be performed later.\n- The creation of a watertight seal is difficult and nephrectomy may be required if the injury occurs during a procedure in which a vascular prosthesis is being implanted (e.g., an aortic reconstructive procedure) and contamination of the foreign body by urine must be avoided."

            "explanation": "- If a rupture of the urethra is suspected, a retrograde urethrogram should be obtained before any attempts are made to place a Foley catheter, as efforts to do so may result in the creation of multiple false passages or conversion of a partial laceration into complete rupture.\n- Previously, treatment had included attempts to realign the urethra immediately through the placement of interlocking sounds and traction using either a catheter passed over the sounds or perineal traction sutures through the bladder neck.\n- Preferred treatment currently avoids both dissection into the pelvic hematoma surrounding the disruption and manipulation of the urethra; instead, only a suprapubic tube is placed immediately with delayed reconstruction after 3-6 mo, at which time the hematoma will have resolved and the prostate will have descended into the proximity of the urogenital diaphragm.\n- Percutaneous nephrostomy has no role in the management of this problem."
