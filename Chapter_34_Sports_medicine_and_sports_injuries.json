            ],
            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Tendons are made up of tightly packed type-1 collagen bundles or fascicles that are contained with endotenon and then in turn epitenon. Tendons heal by fibroblasts laying down new collagen. As a tendon heals following injury there is a period when it is significantly weaker, particularly for 7 to 10 days after injury, before the strength recovers over the first month, but does not approach near to normal until 6 months. Inflammation of the membrane surrounding the tendon (paratendinitis) routinely has a good prognosis following a period of analgesia and rest. Tendinosis (degeneration of the tendon itself) can be completely asymptomatic before it presents with failure."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Most soft tissue haematomas resolve spontaneously, but if they are very large they can become infected or a cyst may form, and in rare cases the cyst may need excising. This is, however, a last resort. The anterior compartment of the thigh includes the quadriceps muscles, along with psoas major, iliacus, sartorius and pectineus. All are innervated by the femoral nerve, except for psoas (lumbar plexus); pectineus occasionally gets a branch from the obturator nerve in addition. The quadriceps muscles are detailed in Table 34.2. Quadriceps tears in athletes commonly involve the rectus femoris muscle, particularly the aponeurosis. Complete quadriceps ruptures are less common. Injuries to the knee normally occur following either a direct blow or twisting mechanism to the knee. A rapid onset effusion is indicative of blood in knee (haemoarthrosis) and is associated with a cruciate rupture (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament), intra-articular fracture (e.g., tibial plateau), or patella dislocation. Isolated meniscal injuries frequently present with a slow onset effusion and possibly true locking of the knee. Damaged muscle can be replaced with cartilage and even bone (myositis ossificans)."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Injuries to the ankle are common in sports, with ankle sprains one of the most common causes of morbidity. The Ottawa ankle rules can help to determine whether radiographs are required following an injury to the ankle. These include the following: • Bony tenderness over the lateral malleolus, distal 6-cm posterior margin • Bony tenderness over the medial malleolus, tip or distal 6-cm posterior margin • Inability to weight bear at time of injury or on presentation Fractures to the ankle are routinely classified according to the AO-Weber classification, which is based on AP and lateral x-rays of the ankle. This classification helps to guide management (Table 29.3). The anatomic reduction of an ankle fracture is crucial as it is an intra-articular injury. It is suggested that if the articular fragments heal more than 2 mm out of place, there will be such high peak loads on the articular cartilage that premature osteoarthritis will result. Following anatomic reduction of any fracture, there can be no guarantee regarding function or strength in the long term. Fracture reduction is not associated with the risk of osteoporosis."

            "explanation": "Lateral epicondylitis, commonly known as tennis elbow, is common and affects up to 50% of tennis players. It is characterised by eccentric loading (repetitive supination-pronation with extended elbow), often from repetitive micro-trauma, of the common extensor origin (frequently ECRB), leading to tendinosis and inflammation. Degeneration, repair and rupture of the aponeurotic fibres can occur. Patients are tender over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, with the pain reproduced on resisted wrist or long finger extension. Grip strength may be diminished, as this causes pain. Conservative measures are successful in the vast majority of cases and can include activity modification, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), physiotherapy, bracing and steroid injections. Surgery (common extensor origin debridement and release) is very rarely indicated and should only be considered after a prolonged trial of nonoperative measures. Medial epicondylitis, commonly known as golfer's elbow, is a similar but much less common condition that affects the common flexor origin (FCR and pronator teres frequently). It is often more difficult to manage."

            "explanation": "Scaphoid fractures are the most common fracture of the carpus. Risk factors for a true scaphoid fracture have been found to be male gender and sports injuries, with goalkeepers most susceptible. Up to 30% to 40% of scaphoid fractures are not identified on routine primary four-view radiographs (see Chapter 29), with the clinical scaphoid fracture a diagnostic conundrum. Repeat assessment, including further imaging in the form or CT or MRI, might be required to diagnose the occult fracture. Patients are classically tender over the anatomical snuffbox, although this has very poor specificity. Treatment for undisplaced fractures routinely involves 6 to 12 weeks in a below-elbow cast. There is evidence to suggest that percutaneous screw fixation of undisplaced or minimally displaced fractures has a shorter time to return to work and sports."

            "explanation": "Compression of the posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) is associated with kayaking, amongst other things. The radial nerve passes anterior to the humeral lateral epicondyle, crossing the antecubital fossa behind brachioradialis. Once it enters the forearm it divides into the following deep and superficial branches: • Deep branch → posterior interosseous nerve: passes between two heads of supinator, winds around the radial neck, supplies posterior forearm compartment travelling down the forearm posterior to the interosseous membrane. • Superficial branch → superficial branch of the radial nerve: travels distally posterior to brachioradialis and provides cutaneous supply to the lateral dorsum of the hand. Compression of the PIN is likely to be due to repetitive pronation-supination movements associated with paddling. The presentation depends on the chronicity of the problem, with weakness (or even atrophy) of the wrist and hand extensors possible. Nerve conduction studies can confirm the diagnosis and level of compression. Nonoperative treatment is first line and involves activity modification, NSAIDs, physiotherapy, splints and possibly steroid injections. Decompression of the nerve is considered after a prolonged trial of nonoperative management, with a variable outcome."

It commonly occurs when a rugby player attempts to grab an opposition player's jersey. According to the Verden zones, this is a Zone 1 (midpoint middle phalanx to fingertip) injury. The ring finger is commonly affected, and the severity of the injury can be classified according to the Leddy and Packer classification that takes into account how far back the tendon has retracted and whether there is a bony avulsion fragment. On clinical assessment, the history is one of inability to flex the DIPJ. Radiographs of the affected finger are required to exclude an associated bony avulsion. Treatment is with tendon repair +/- fixation of any osseous fragment."

This is an acute intrinsic injury that is most commonly seen in males following a sports injury. Associated injuries include a tear the medial meniscus and the medial collateral ligament (triad of O'Donoghue). The ACL has a blood supply (unlike the meniscus) and so the knee swells immediately with blood (haemoarthrosis), and normally the person will not be able to continue. Patients can present chronically with a history of trauma and recurrent problems of instability when getting back to increasing levels of activity, e.g., knee giving way on changing direction. On clinical assessment the diagnosis of a disrupted ACL is made with a positive anterior draw test or positive Lachmann's test, both of which test for abnormal subluxation of the tibia forward on the femur. The pivot shift test is another test. Radiographs of the knee to exclude a bony injury, followed by MRI are routine (Figure 34.3). Treatment is with rest, analgesia and physiotherapy. If the patient has ongoing problems with instability, ligament reconstruction using a tendon graft, e.g., hamstring, can be performed."

Missed diagnosis in the acute setting does occur. This posterior displacement of the flexed tibia on the femur ruptures the PCL. Multi-ligamentous injury can occur. Patients with a ruptured PCL have a positive anterior draw test (just like a patient with a ruptured anterior cruciate). However, the draw is forward from a posterior sag position. It is therefore the posterior sag which is diagnostic. Radiographs of the knee to exclude a bony injury followed by MRI are the investigations of choice. Surgery for athletes is often indicated."

            "explanation": "This woman presents with a history that is classical of true locking of the knee, most likely secondary to a meniscus tear. In this case, it is likely the medial meniscus given her area of discomfort. If the tear is bucket-handled in shape, then sometimes the bucket handle will fold over and lock in the knee joint. In the chronic setting, the patient then has to wiggle the knee to relocate the torn fragment before she can move the knee again. The patient may have a positive McMurray's test, but this is not highly sensitive or specific, and the injury is best diagnosed by MRI or arthroscopy. In the acute setting, a torn meniscus sometimes allows a sportsperson to play on and may not swell until some hours later. For a symptomatic patient, arthroscopy with menisectomy or repair can be performed. If the meniscal tear is peripheral and amenable to repair, this is likely to give the best outcome, as peripheral tears have a good vascular supply."

            "explanation": "Patella dislocation is one of the more common acute intrinsic injuries to the knee. It is most frequent in the second and third decades. Risk factors can include trochlear dysplasia, ligamentous laxity and patella alta. The patella dislocates, but then spontaneous reduction occurs (as it so often does). The knee will be painful and swollen initially and so will be difficult to examine, but once the initial inflammation has settled the patient will be left with a patella apprehension sign. Any attempt to push the patella laterally as you passively flex the knee will be resisted by the patient, who will have a sense of discomfort and apprehension. Radiographs are important to rule out any bony injury, and there should be a low threshold for further imaging, particularly in younger patients, to determine whether there has been any damage to the articular cartilage. Conservative measures are the mainstay of treatment unless there is an acute bony pathology or recurrent problems with instability."
