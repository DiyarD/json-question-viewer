            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is an idiopathic condition that is characterised by the spontaneous onset of a stiff and painful (severe initially) shoulder. It commonly affects women in the sixth decade and is associated with minor trauma or previous surgery, comorbidities (diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, thyroid disease) and prolonged immobilisation of the shoulder. There is often an initial global reduction in passive and active shoulder movement, but loss of external rotation is pathognomonic. Imaging is routinely normal, although MRI may demonstrate contracture of the joint capsule. The mainstays of treatment are conservative measures including analgesia, steroid injections, distension arthrogram and physiotherapy. Most cases resolve within 1 to 3 years following onset. MUA or arthroscopic surgical release may be used in refractory cases."

            ],
            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "Total shoulder arthroplasty (Figure 36.1) routinely provides good pain relief postoperatively; however, pain relief cannot be guaranteed with any surgery. Replacement does not routinely significantly increase the range of movement in the shoulder. Pain relief provided by a glenohumeral arthrodesis may result in a comparable or even better range of movements than a replacement, as the full range of movements available in the scapulothoracic joint can be utilised.\nPrerequisites for total shoulder replacement are an intact rotator cuff and good glenoid bone stock. Rotator cuff deficiency (proximal migration of humerus, diagnosed on further imaging) makes total shoulder arthroplasty much less reliable unless the cuff can be repaired at the same time (rare), in which case hemi-arthroplasty or a reverse shoulder replacement is recommended. If the glenoid is well preserved, a hemi-arthroplasty can give good results, although pain relief is less predictable."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "The ulnar nerve arises from the brachial plexus medial cord (C8-T1). After median neuropathy, ulnar nerve compression (cubital tunnel syndrome) is the next most common compressive neuropathy of the upper limb, with the common compression sites around the elbow being the following:\n• Arcade of Struthers\n• Two heads of flexor carpi ulnaris (aponeurosis)\n• Medial epicondyle\n• Medial intermuscular septum\nThere may be a background of previous elbow trauma leading to a cubitus varus or valgus deformity. Patients often present with paraesthesia in the little and ring fingers, with possibly a positive Tinel's sign over the compression site. A classic claw hand may be seen when compression of the ulnar nerve occurs at the wrist (e.g., at Guyon's canal), whereas with compression at the elbow, paradoxically (ulnar paradox) the claw is less pronounced due to the loss of innervation to the medial two digits flexor digitorum profundus. Motor findings include the following examples of wasting and weakness of the hand intrinsics:\n• Hypothenar (abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi opponens digiti minimi)\n• Adductor pollicis: Positive Froment's sign (see Chapter 33)\n• Interossei: Abduction (dorsal) and adduction (palmar) of the fingers\n• 3rd and 4th lumbricals\nAP and lateral radiographs of the elbow will exclude potential bony causes, e.g., osteophytes or previous trauma (supracondylar fracture leading to cubitus varus or valgus). Diagnosis is through clinical assessment and nerve-conduction studies. Conservative measures (e.g., analgesia and activity modification) are the primary lines of treatment, with surgery involving decompression +/– transposition."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Prevention and management of hand swelling and stiffness is essential to prevent permanent fibrosis and contracture leading to a loss of function. This can occur following trauma, infection, or surgery. Elevation is used to reduce swelling, particularly in the acute period. Splintage in a safe position aims to prevent contractures. The Edinburgh position of safety involves MCPJ flexion at 90°, with PIPJ and DIPJ in full extension. Early movement reduces swelling and prevents permanent stiffness."

            "explanation": "There are a large number of deformities associated with rheumatoid arthritis (Figure 36.2). However, the deviation of the MCP joints is ulnar, not radial, whereas in the wrist the deviation is radial. Deformities are associated with synovial inflammation and attrition trauma, with potential abnormalities being the following:\n• Extensor and flexor tendon ruptures\n• MCPJ deformity: ulnar +/– volar deviation with associated subluxation/dislocation\n• Wrist deformities: radial deviation, carpal supination, prominent ulna head\n• Boutonnière deformity (DIPJ hyperextension and PIPJ flexion)\n• Swan neck deformity (PIPJ hyperextension and MCPJ + DIPJ flexion)\n• Z-thumb deformity (FPL rupture)\nPotential surgical management options include the following:\n• Synovectomy: Gives good pain relief, improves function and potentially prevents tendon rupture or nerve compression.\n• Ulna head excision: Reduces pain and risk of extensor tendon rupture but wrist instability can be a problem in younger patients, so replacement may be necessary.\n• Wrist and small joint arthrodesis: Provides good pain relief and improves function.\n• Prosthetic replacement of MCPJs.\n• Tendon transfer is preferred to repair."

            "explanation": "This case is characteristic of rotator cuff impingement, which commonly occurs as the cuff travels inferior to the acromion. The 'painful arc' is pain on active shoulder abduction, commonly between 40 and 120 degrees. Special tests include Neer, Hawkins and Jobe test (see Chapter 33). This condition can be diagnosed with an injection of local anaesthetic into the impinging area, and some patients' symptoms can settle with this in combination with physiotherapy. Subacromial decompression is the surgical option."

            "explanation": "Calcific tendintis is thought to be associated with degenerative changes of rotator cuff pathology. It is seen between 20 and 50 years of age and is associated with diabetes. Severe pain and stiffness developing rapidly without any trauma can be either a frozen shoulder or calcifying tendinitis of the supraspinatus tendon. Frozen shoulder produces global pain and loss of movement, in particular external rotation. Calcific tendinitis usually does not affect external rotation to that degree but is associated with a painful arc and might have signs of impingement. Radiographs confirm the finding of a calcific deposit within the supraspinatus tendon between the acromion and the humeral head.\nConservative measures include analgesia, steroid injection, physiotherapy, or ultrasound-guided decompression of the deposit. Surgery involves arthroscopic removal of the calcific deposit +/– decompression."

Some suggest an association with pregnancy, repetitive micro trauma, e.g., golf, as well as inflammatory arthropathies.\nClinical presentation is pain, tenderness and swelling over the lateral aspect of the thumb or wrist, with crepitus sometimes felt. Finkelstein's test can be positive (flex affected thumb into palm, first made around thumb, wrist ulnar deviation). Radiographs can be used to exclude other differentials, e.g., base of thumb osteoarthritis. Management includes the following:\n• Conservative: Activity modification, analgesia, e.g., NSAIDs, splints, or corticosteroid injection\n• Surgery: Release of first dorsal compartment"

            "explanation": "Triggering of the fingers or thumb is due to tendon sheath inflammation and fibrotic thickening, ultimately leading to a tendon-sheath size mismatch (stenosis). This causes restricted movement of the flexor tendon and the tendon becoming entrapped within the retinacular pulley, usually at the first annular (A1) pulley of the ring or middle fingers. Patients, usually females, are often between 40 and 60 years of age. Associated conditions include diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, amyloidosis and gout. On examination, a tender nodule can be found on the flexor aspect of the affected finger or thumb, with the digit locked in flexion when passive extension is attempted. The digit usually becomes 'unlocked' with passive force, with a trigger-like pop felt (Green classification). If initial treatment with conservative measures fails (e.g., physiotherapy, steroid injection), surgery to release +/– debride the pulley can be performed."

            "explanation": "Dupuytren's contracture is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by palmar fascial nodules and cords, skin puckering with progressive fibrotic hyperplasia of the palmar and digital fascia, resulting in fixed flexion deformities of the affected fingers. It is seen commonly in people of northern European descent, males and in those who are between 40 and 60 years of age. Risk factors include smoking, trauma/postsurgery, epilepsy medication, AIDS/ HIV, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and alcohol cirrhosis.\nThe disease can be bilateral, pain is not common and the ring or little fingers are most commonly involved. Associated presentations include the following:\n• Ledderhose disease: Plantar fibromatosis leading to thickening\n• Peyronie's disease: Penile fibromatosis leading to curvature\n• Garrod's knuckle pads: Thickened skin dorsum PIPJ\nThe Hueston tabletop test (unable to place open palm on table) can be used as indication for surgery, along with PIPJ flexion contracture. Management includes the following:\n• Nonoperative: Collagenase therapy\n• Surgery: Fasciotomy, fasciectomy, dermofasciectomy, or amputation"

            "explanation": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most frequent upper limb compressive neuropathy. It is characterised by compression and ischaemia of the nerve as it passes underneath the flexor retinaculum at the wrist. It is commonly seen in middle-aged females. Risk factors include obesity, smoking, alcohol excess, diabetes, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid, amyloidosis, pregnancy, trauma and possibly occupation.\nPatients commonly present with tingling and numbness of the radial three and half digits, which is often worse at night and relieved by shaking the hand (the 'Flick sign'). Although commonly quoted, pain is not classical. Reduced sensation over the radial three and half digits, thenar muscle atrophy and abductor pollicis brevis weakness can be found. Provocation tests include the following:\n• Phalen's test (flexion of wrist until symptoms come on)\n• Tinel's test\nThe diagnosis is made either clinically, with nerve-conduction studies, or with a combination of the two. Management includes the following:\n• Nonoperative: Activity modification, night splints, steroid injections\n• Operative: Open or endoscopic carpal tunnel decompression"
