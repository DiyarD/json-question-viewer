            "explanation": "- Opioid-use disorder and HIV/AIDS are common co-diagnoses.\n- Methadone metabolism is complicated, undergoing oxidative metabolism by the cytochrome p450 system in the liver, with significant interindividual variability.\n- Efavirenz (a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) induces and inhibits several p450 enzymes, resulting in a 50% decrease in methadone bioavailability within several weeks of initiation.\n- Starting efavirenz precipitated opioid withdrawal symptoms despite no change in methadone dosing.\n- A low serum methadone trough level will confirm this and allow for appropriate replacement therapy or reconsideration of efavirenz use.\n- The patient lacks symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease, liver disease, or *Helicobacter pylori* infection.\n- Procalcitonin determination would not change his care or aid in diagnosis as it is for differentiating infection from other inflammatory conditions."

            "explanation": "- Severely injured or septic patients may not tolerate abdominal closure at the index operation.\n- Delaying return to the operating room decreases the likelihood of primary fascial closure; the first return should be as soon as possible (within 24 hours) but no later than 48 hours.\n- The use of intravenous 3% hypertonic saline is associated with increased rates of primary fascial closure, likely due to an osmotic gradient favoring removal of intestinal edema.\n- Forced diuresis with a loop diuretic drip is not associated with increased rates of fascial closure.\n- No specific evidence suggests that early renal replacement therapy or keeping central venous pressures below a certain level help with closure."
