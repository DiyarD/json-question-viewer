            "explanation": "The cancer cell is independent of signals that control the process of multiplication, thus distinguishing it from the normal cell. In normal wound healing, cellular proliferation is coordinated in an orderly manner such that the process occurs when it is needed, as in injury, and ceases when healing is complete. Cancer cells are free from such constraints, causing them to grow and proliferate and thus demonstrating their autonomous nature. In the human body, there are aberrant forms of normal cellular genes, called oncogenes, responsible for malignant change.\nCancer cells do not respect tissue planes and have the ability to break into the basement membrane and invade blood and lymphatic vessels, which form the perfect transport system to metastasise. The cells secrete enzymes, collagenases and proteases, which dissolve the boundaries formed by extracellular matrix, thus helping their invasion and spread.\nHaving gained access to the lymphatics and blood vessels, the body's natural transport system, the cancer cell develops the propensity to disseminate throughout the body. The 'seed and soil hypothesis' of Stephen Paget explains the ability of certain host organs to ‘invite' clinical metastases. Although the cancer cell (seed) may settle into an organ (soil), the cell may not grow to form a clinical metastasis. When the soil is fertile, as in liver, lungs, bone, brain and lymphatics, implantation of the cancer cell occurs, producing overt metastases. This is done by the cancer cells producing inflammatory cytokines, making the soil fertile enough to allow the seed to grow into a ‘plant or sapling' (metastasis).\nBlood flow within a tumour is haphazard. This may result in the cancer cell living in an environment of hypoxia or at times where there is profuse vascularity when oxygen is abundant. In the latter situation there is aerobic (oxygenated) glycolysis causing the pyruvate to go to the mitochondria ultimately producing lactate. The cancer cells use this to produce energy. This phenomenon is called the Warburg effect, which was first described by Otto Warburg, a Nobel Laureate. The phenomenon of aerobic glycolysis is used in the technique of positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, which uses radiolabelled glucose to see tumours.\nApoptosis is programmed cell death seen in the normal human and is a physiological process that is a self-regulatory mechanism in growth and development. Cancer cells evolve mechanisms to prevent apoptosis. For example, the p53 gene is a tumour suppressor gene that activates apoptosis. Loss of function in such a tumour suppressor gene will contribute to malignancy."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "It is genomic instability that contributes to cancer development. As the pathogenesis of cancer involves multiple genetic events, genomic instability contributes to mutations in the DNA of tumour cells. The most important factor of genomic instability is chromosome instability.\nA normal cell in the human body undergoes a finite number of divisions. This limitation is caused by shortening of the end of the chromosome (telomere) every time the cell divides. With each cell division there is telomeric attrition, which ultimately causes cell death. But cancer cells produce an enzyme telomerase that extends the length of the telomeres, thus allowing continued cell division thereby conferring on the cancer cell the quality of immortality. Along with the ability of immortality, cancer cells have the unique ability in a tumour to form new blood vessels, a phenomenon termed ‘angiogenic competence'.\nAnother aspect that perpetuates the growth of malignancy is the ability of a tumour to provoke an inflammatory response. This produces cytokines that help to elaborate growth factors, angiogenic factors (see previous section) and anti-apoptotic factors, all of which contribute to the progression of a tumour. A certain feature of cancer biology is the unpredictable nature of the condition. The unpredictable nature of cancer is obvious by the clinical application of the Gompertzian growth factor (Gompertz being an insurance actuary). The major part of the growth of a tumour has occurred before it is clinically detected; when tumours are detected they have passed their stage of most rapid growth, thus making them less amenable to chemotherapy. In many patients at presentation cancer has already become a systemic disease."

            ],
            "explanation": "The aetiology of cancer can broadly be divided into two causes – environmental factors (80%) and genetic inheritance (20%). The environmental contributions as a cause of cancer are manifold and include smoking (lung), alcohol (oesophageal, liver), ultraviolet exposure (skin), ionising radiation (lymphomas), viral infection (cervix), parasitic infection (Bilharziasis in urinary bladder, H. pylori in stomach), chemicals (aniline dye in bladder, immunosuppression in Kaposi's sarcoma, tamoxifen in endometrium) and obesity (breast and others). Genetic factors are in the vast majority from an autosomal dominant inheritance. They are familial adenomatous polyposis coli (APC gene), hereditary non-polyposis coli cancer (DNA mismatch repair genes) also associated with endometrial, stomach, ureter and renal pelvis, MEN syndrome 2A causing medullary thyroid cancer (RET gene), familial breast cancer (BRCA1 and 2) and other less common cancers. The purpose of knowing the aetiology is to provide strategies to prevent the disease by changing the environmental and behavioural factors and offering genetic counselling.\nScreening, prevention, accurate diagnosis, staging, treatment and rehabilitation should form the overall management of cancer. Once diagnosed, it is a 'cancer journey' that the patient has to take. Several criteria for screening are set out. The disease should be common; early treatment should make a difference in enhancing the longevity; the test should be sensitive, specific, inexpensive and safe; diagnostic facilities should be readily available for those with positive tests; and benefit must outweigh physical and psychological harm.\nAccurate diagnosis is crucial in the management. In this regard, the cellular architecture, differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, grading and local and distant staging are necessary. These factors are often given numerical points to obtain an overall score of the cancer to accurately stratify the disease. This would enable the team to mount the most effective treatment, which may turn out to be a combination of modalities as decided by the multidisciplinary team (MDT)."

                "E Chemotherapy acts by selective toxicity."
            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "Once diagnosed, the cancer should not be excised at the earliest; it would be poor surgical principle to do so. The condition should be staged, scored if appropriate, discussed in a MDT and then the best form of treatment instituted. The team looking after a complex cancer patient (such as head and neck cancer) should not only be multidisciplinary but multi-professional, the latter having a larger number of members. In certain cases, surgery may not be best form of treatment at the outset.\nWhen the diagnosis has been confirmed on histology, the extent of the disease should be staged, both locally and regionally. Technological advances in recent years have revolutionised the staging of cancer. Depending upon the particular type of cancer and the organ involved, contrast enhanced CT scan, MRI, PET scan, ultrasound (US), laparoscopy +/– US and sentinel node biopsy (using radiolabelled colloid) all have an important role in mapping the disease as accurately as possible. Tumour markers have an important place also in follow up.\nSurgery is one of tri-modal methods of treating cancer, the other two being radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The latter two can be expressed in reproducible units. For example, in the case of drugs, milligrams, and Grays (Gy) in the case of radiation; but, for example, it is not possible to describe in units of measure an operation such as a hemicolectomy.\nRadiotherapy acts by producing damage to the DNA of dividing cells. While this explains the biological effects, radiation also has effects on gene expression thereby working as a targeted form of gene therapy. Chemotherapy acts by selective toxicity and often is used for palliation rather than cure. Therefore, in its use one must make sure that the effect of the treatment is not worse than the disease. Cytotoxic drugs are usually used in combination and often along with radiotherapy. When choosing a combination of drugs, the principles are to use drugs with distinct mode of action; use drugs against the disease; and use drugs with non-overlapping toxicities."

                "D"
            ],
            "explanation": "Radical cancer surgery entails removal of the primary tumour, as much of the surrounding tissue as possible and lymph nodes to achieve local control. Ultraradical surgery, which used to be done for breast cancer, has hardly any effect on the development of metastatic spread. Meticulous surgical technique with minimal handling of the primary tumour is the key to good surgery that would prevent local recurrence.\nSurgical excision of metastases must be considered under certain circumstances. Excision of liver metastases from colorectal cancer and pulmonary secondaries from testicular cancer, which is usually seen in the younger patient, gives good palliation. Overall management of cancer in general consists of all three modalities – surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy – depending upon the patient, type of cancer and stage. Neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and radiotherapy) is used to downstage the tumour prior to surgery.\nWhen radical surgery cannot be carried out, palliative treatment is the answer. This would be in a patient who has distant metastases with a resectable primary, for example, a colorectal carcinoma with liver secondaries. Palliative care is not the same as end-of-life care. Patients may survive for months, if not years, with palliative care and good symptomatic control. End-of-life care is different from palliative care. It concerns the last few months or weeks of a patient's life. This may entail non-medical issues such as bereavement counselling (with family and friends), spirituality, alternative therapies and community support at home."

            "explanation": "1. Bone secondary: This patient who underwent a nephrectomy for renal carcinoma has a typical bone secondary in a long bone (femur in this case). Bone secondaries in renal carcinomas characteristically are osteolytic and very vascular. He needs an operation of internal fixation of the secondary to be followed by radiotherapy in the postoperative period.\n2. Carcinoma of breast: This patient would undergo the appropriate surgery for local treatment of her breast carcinoma (mastectomy +/– reconstruction or breast conservation surgery) followed by chemotherapy for her node-positive lymph nodes.\n3. Carcinoma of descending colon: This patient has undergone a radical left hemicolectomy. Postoperative staging is Dukes' stage B, which means that the growth has extended to extra-colonic tissues without lymph-node metastasis. Such patients benefit from a course of chemotherapy. (Dukes' staging initially was instituted for rectal carcinoma but later extended to all large bowel cancers).\n4. Carcinoma of head of pancreas: This patient requires palliation from her itching. This is ideally achieved by inserting a stent endoscopically into the common bile duct. Failing this, external biliary drainage can be carried out by interventional radiology. Sometimes, if the patient has gastric outlet obstruction, he or she may need a stent insertion into the pylorus. If, for technical reasons, none of these methods are successful, then the patient will need the palliative operative procedure of triple bypass.\n5. Carcinoma of prostate: This patient has multiple bone secondaries from a prostatic carcinoma. He is best treated by palliative radiotherapy. This can be supplemented by hormonal manipulation by performing bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy or carrying out a chemical castration with drugs.\n6. Carcinoma of rectum: This patient has a locally advanced rectal carcinoma that has spread to the lateral pelvic wall. The patient should undergo a course of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy over a period of 6 weeks. This should downstage the tumour, following which an anterior resection with total mesorectal excision should be carried out.\n7. Medullary thyroid carcinoma: This patient should undergo a total thyroidectomy with resection of central and bilateral cervical lymph nodes. Follow up should entail serum calcitonin at regular intervals.\n8. Multiple liver metastases: This patient has multiple liver secondaries from a carcinoid tumour excised in the past. The liver secondaries are producing the hormone serotonin, giving the patient carcinoid syndrome with distressing symptoms. This can be palliated well by the interventional radiological technique of chemoembolisation thus destroying the secondaries, which will not be able to produce serotonin.\n9. Pulmonary secondaries: This young man has developed lung secondaries from treated testicular teratoma. He should be discussed in a MDT where the outcome would certainly be resection of the secondaries (metastasectomy). Consideration should be given to postoperative chemotherapy. The management of testicular tumours is changing all the time. He might even be considered for preoperative chemotherapy, to be followed by surgery.\n10. Thyroid lymphoma: This patient with a proven thyroid lymphoma, which is localised to the thyroid, is treated by external beam radiotherapy."
