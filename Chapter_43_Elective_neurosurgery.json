Somatic mutations in P53, PTEN and NF1 are frequent in gliomas in general, and syndromes involving germline mutation in these genes predispose to these and other tumours. HNPCC is associated with a number of distinct gene mutations affecting DNA mismatch repair, and collectively these mutations also confer increased risk of glioma. Certain menin gene mutations confer risk of risk of pituitary adenoma (MEN Type I- pituitary, parathyroid, pancreas). MEN Type II is associated with medullary thyroid cancer, phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid tumours."

Infection by the spectrum of organisms implicated in postsurgical meningitis, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Pneumococci, is a recognized complication, and these organisms are also typical in postsurgical abscess. N. meningitides and H. influenzae are found in spontaneous bacterial meningitis, and cryptococcal and tuberculous abscesses are the result of haematogenous spread."

There is a high risk of meningitis, especially if the sac has ruptured, and early surgery is preferred to close the defect prior to surface bacterial colonization. Prolactinomas (Figure 43.2a) are typically managed medically using dopamine antagonists, except in cases of rapid visual deterioration. Surgical resection of metastases is generally limited to solitary lesions in patients with well-controlled systemic disease and good functional status. Trigeminal neuralgia is managed pharmacologically in the first instance; surgical microvascular decompression is the gold standard for treatment of refractory primary neuralgia. Arachnoid cysts (Figure 43.2b) are usually an incidental finding, so that often follow-up imaging only to exclude enlargement is required."

Papilloedema is slow to develop and might be altogether absent in acute shunt blockage. Shunt infection or the combination of infection and blockage should also be considered.\n2. C Low pressure headache\nShunt overdrainage accounts for significant morbidity, with postural headaches reflecting the siphon effect of the distal peritoneal shunt catheter when the patient is standing. ICP monitoring might be useful to confirm a correlation between low pressure and headache.\n3. A Pathology unrelated to the shunt\nHeadaches are common, irrespective of the presence of a VP shunt; in this case, the unilateral pain and aura are suggestive of migraine.\n4. E Shunt infection\nFever and meningism imply shunt infection unless the CSF provides evidence to the contrary.\n5. D Subdural haematoma\nSubdural haematoma is a potential complication of shunt overdrainage especially in the elderly (Figure 43.3)."

B Brain abscess\nBrain abscess can present with fever, focal neurological deficit and raised ICP. This presentation should prompt urgent investigation (Figure 43.4). Local spread from an infected middle ear is common.\n3. D Brain tumour\nFocal neurological deficit, seizure and raised ICP are the classic triad of presenting features. Headache is not typically the main complaint at presentation.\n4. C Intracerebral haemorrhage\nICH typically presents with progressive focal deficit as the accumulating blood dissects and impinges on eloquent tissue. Larger volume bleeds can then lead to raised ICP as compensation is exhausted.\n5. A Subarachnoid haemorrhage\nThunderclap headache with an onset that can be pinpointed in time is classical for subarachnoid haemorrhage. Ongoing fever and meningism stemming from meningeal irritation by blood are very compatible with this diagnosis."

            "explanation": "1. B Communicating hydrocephalus\nAcute bacterial meningitis causes accumulation of protein and cellular debris in the CSF, and this can compromise reabsorption at the arachnoid villi. Obstruction of CSF flow by accumulation of these constituents is also seen occasionally.\n2. C Hydrocephalus ex vacuo\nVentriculomegaly in the context of cognitive decline is most commonly secondary to brain atrophy, 'hydrocephalus ex vacuo.' Lumbar infusion and lumbar drainage testing can be helpful where there is clinical doubt. Failure to improve after CSF drainage makes normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) unlikely.\n3. A Idiopathic intracranial hypertension\nProgressive headache and visual disturbance over months in a young obese female is strongly suggestive of IIH. The condition is also known as pseudotumuor cerebri, and head imaging by MRI to exclude a space-occupying lesion is mandatory prior to lumbar puncture to confirm the diagnosis.\n4. D Normal pressure hydrocephalus\nThe classic triad of cognitive decline, urine incontinence and gait disturbance, together with a good response to CSF drainage, suggests a diagnosis of NPH and predicts a good response to long-term CSF diversion using a shunt.\n5. E Obstructive hydrocephalus\nSpace-occupying lesions, especially within the ventricles or in proximity to the cerebral aqueduct, can produce mass effect resulting in an obstructive hydrocephalus."

The insidious nature of the presentation is suggestive of a low-grade lesion such as meningioma (Figure 43.5).\n2. B Medulloblastoma\nThe boy's presentation is suggestive of posterior fossa pathology, with cerebellar dysfunction progressing to evidence of acute hydrocephalus, which is likely to require immediate CSF diversion. Medulloblastoma, a posterior fossa tumour, is among the most common solid organ tumours in this age group (Figure 43.6).\n3. D Parietal lobe metastasis\nParietal lobe lesions can produce subtle deficits including sensory attention. Dominant lobe lesions can result in Gerstmann's syndrome (acalculia, agraphia, left-right disorientation and finger agnosia).\n4. C Pituitary adenoma\nThe patient's presentation is suggestive of pituitary apoplexy, the clinical manifestation of acute haemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumour.\n5.
