            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- Lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage is common, especially in the elderly.\n- Urgent diagnosis and treatment are indicated for patients who continue to bleed significantly.\n- Urgent colonoscopy is diagnostic and therapeutic in a patient with hematochezia.\n- Bowel preparation is useful but should not delay the procedure.\n- Early colonoscopy is associated with shorter length of stay, is most cost-effective, and has a higher diagnostic yield.\n- Nuclear scintigraphy detects acute bleeding but does not identify etiology or provide therapy; it is mostly useful as an adjunct.\n- Mesenteric angiography requires a higher bleeding rate (0.5 mL/minute) and is risky; it is reserved for massive bleeding. CT angiography is often preferred.\n- Surgery for lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage is usually not necessary.\n- Nasogastric tube aspirate with bile makes an upper GI source less likely; if colonoscopy is unrevealing, esophagogastroduodenoscopy would then be indicated."

Malignancy must be considered and explored.\n- Management of benign strictures is dilation therapy (bougies or balloons).\n- Most strictures require 1-3 dilations, but approximately one-quarter will require additional sessions.\n- Strictures are refractory if a 14 mm diameter cannot be achieved over 5 sessions at 2-week intervals. Strictures are recurrent if a satisfactory diameter cannot be maintained for 4 weeks.\n- The patient must be maintained on acid suppression therapy to prevent stricture recurrence.\n- Gastrostomy tube placement is premature after only one dilation.\n- Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is considered once the stricture is successfully dilated and GERD is confirmed.\n- Heller myotomy is indicated for achalasia and would have no effect on a luminal stricture.\n- Esophagectomy is the last resort for a refractory or recurrent stricture after all other options have been exhausted."

            "question": "A 56-year-old woman with frequent heartburn and antacid use presents with a 3-year history of intermittent dysphagia to solid food only. When this occurs, she feels as if the food becomes stuck in the retrosternal area. She has otherwise been healthy, has no significant medical history, and has no other complaints. Esophagram reveals a smooth, short stricture located in the distal esophagus. A biopsy does not demonstrate cancer. Esophageal manometry is normal. Which of the following statements is true regarding treatment of this stricture?",
            "options": [
                "A. Dilation is contraindicated",
                "B. Lumen size after dilation does not correspond with symptom relief.",
                "C. Proton pump inhibitors reduce the need for subsequent dilation.",
                "D. Injection of the stricture with corticosteroids is superior to dilation.",
                "E. Placement of an expandable metal stent is first-line treatment."
            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Benign strictures of the esophagus have a significant negative effect on patients' quality of life.\n- The initial treatment of choice is endoscopic peroral dilation with bougies or balloons; approximately 40% of patients require only a single dilation.\n- The size of the lumen at the conclusion of the dilation generally correlates with symptom relief.\n- In patients with peptic strictures, the coexistence of esophagitis may be a contributing cause of dysphagia. Patients who demonstrated healing of their esophagitis with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) after dilation had complete resolution of dysphagia, whereas those with continued esophagitis required repeat dilations.\n- Topical corticosteroids are second-line therapy in eosinophilic esophagitis, after acid suppression. There is no current role for injectable steroids in peptic stricture.\n- Expandable metal stents are successful for palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction, but when used for benign strictures result in multiple complications (e.g., in-growth of granulation tissue, obstruction, stent migration, and perforation)."
