            "explanation": "- Surgical resection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma offers the only chance of a curative outcome, but only 10% to 20% of patients present with a surgically resectable mass.\n- Locally advanced tumors are defined by encasement (>180° contact) of celiac axis, common hepatic artery, or superior mesenteric artery (SMA), or occlusion of SMV and PV confluence.\n- With vascular reconstruction, some unresectable tumors are now called borderline resectable.\n- Borderline resectable tumors have no celiac axis or hepatic artery bifurcation involvement but contact: (1) common hepatic artery, (2) less than 180° of SMA, (3) greater than 180° of SMV or PV, or (4) less than 180° of SMV/PV confluence with vein irregularity or thrombosis with potential for venous reconstruction.\n- Patients with borderline resectable disease have a higher risk of positive surgical margin if they undergo initial resection.\n- Neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens offer advantages over standard adjuvant chemotherapy by ensuring a high proportion of patients receive chemoradiation therapy and identifying patients with aggressive tumor biology who will progress to metastatic disease.\n- This patient, with borderline resectable disease, should undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy followed by restaging CT scan and CA19-9 levels.\n- If no disease progression, pancreaticoduodenectomy with venous reconstruction is an option if SMV/PV confluence is occluded.\n- Standard pancreaticoduodenectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy with vascular reconstruction as the first step is not appropriate for borderline resectable tumors.\n- Biliary drainage or palliative bypass is not indicated as there is no evidence of biliary or duodenal obstruction."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "- The primary risk of splenectomy is overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis (OPSI), which is lifelong and greater due to encapsulated organisms.\n- The risk of infection is increased in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals or those not properly immunized.\n- A comprehensive review of splenectomy indications includes trauma, benign hematologic conditions (e.g., red cell disorders, thalassemia syndromes, homozygous sickle cell disease, platelet disorders), lymphoproliferative disease, myelofibrosis, rupture due to infections, and others.\n- Regardless of indication, adjusted short- and long-term risk of death after splenectomy is higher than in the general population.\n- The best prognosis is associated with removal after trauma.\n- The underlying condition and age at removal may influence the risk of OPSI.\n- Prophylactic measures have improved, but other complications of asplenia, like hypercoagulable state with venous thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension, are surfacing.\n- A population-based study at Mayo Clinic (Rochester Epidemiology Project) found that among 96 children who underwent splenectomy from 1966 to 2011 (mean age = 12 years) for various indications (trauma predominating, but also benign hematologic diseases, malignancy, infarction, abscess, before kidney transplant, and iatrogenic injury), 22 patients developed 62 postsplenectomy sepsis events over a 14-year follow-up.\n- Patients with underlying malignancy had a more than a 4-fold increased risk of postsplenectomy sepsis compared with trauma patients."

            "explanation": "- Ventral hernias are a common problem for general surgeons, with recurrence rates escalating with re-repair attempts.\n- For hernias larger than 4 cm, mesh significantly reduces recurrence risk; thus, primary repair alone for an 8-cm hernia is not indicated.\n- Once mesh use is decided, the remaining questions are mesh type (synthetic or biologic) and mesh location (onlay, inlay, sublay, underlay).\n- Two recent meta-analyses found sublay mesh placement to have the highest probability of preventing recurrence.\n- Sublay mesh also has a lower complication rate compared with other techniques.\n- Biologic mesh is associated with a higher recurrence rate and should only be used if synthetic mesh is contraindicated (e.g., contaminated wound)."

            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "- Adrenal incidentalomas are adrenal masses identified incidentally in individuals without clinical symptoms of adrenal disease.\n- Prevalence has increased due to increased abdominal imaging and higher resolution CT scanning.\n- Prevalence is approximately 6% of the general population and tends to be higher in older populations (10-15% bilateral).\n- Adrenal incidentalomas offer an opportunity for early detection of functional adrenal tumors or malignancy.\n- Biochemical workup should exclude excessive secretion of cortisol, aldosterone, catecholamines, or androgens.\n- The main concern for nonsecreting adrenal tumors is potential for malignancy (primary or metastatic).\n- Risk for adrenal cortical carcinoma relates to tumor size, increasing significantly for tumors larger than 6 cm.\n- No tumor size excludes malignancy, but risk for adrenal cortical carcinoma is exceedingly small for tumors smaller than 4 cm with favorable CT imaging characteristics.\n- A 4 cm threshold effectively identifies malignant tumors and reduces unnecessary resections of benign, nonfunctional adrenal disease.\n- Metastatic lesions to adrenal gland can be any size, often smaller than primary adrenal cortical carcinoma, but usually with a prior history of malignancy.\n- Benign adenomatous features are associated with tumors with higher intracellular lipid content, resulting in lower attenuation on nonenhanced CT scans.\n- A threshold of 10 Hounsfield units (HU) distinguishes adrenal adenomas from nonadenomatous lesions with high sensitivity and specificity.\n- If attenuation is greater than 10 HU on nonenhanced CT, further investigation is needed.\n- Contrast washout should be calculated from postcontrast images; washout greater than 60% favors adenoma.\n- In this patient, nonenhanced CT with attenuation >10 HU and contrast washout <60% are concerning for potential malignancy, despite tumor size <4 cm.\n- Adrenalectomy is recommended.\n- Adrenal biopsy may differentiate benign from malignant masses in equivocal cases but is not indicated for masses with suspicious features, as resection would be appropriate regardless of biopsy results.\n- Repeat imaging may be undertaken to assess for interval growth in benign cases, but for concerning imaging characteristics, it may delay resection."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is an uncommon benign liver tumor, more common in women.\n- Hormonal role (oral contraceptives, pregnancy) is implicated in HCA growth and possible regression.\n- HCA carries a risk of rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage, being the second most common cause of spontaneous liver bleed.\n- Risk of rupture is related to tumor size; bleeding risk increases for tumors larger than 5 cm, though smaller tumors can also bleed.\n- Malignant transformation is rare but more common in larger tumors (>5 cm).\n- Hemorrhage can often be treated with angioembolization.\n- Diagnosis of HCA is usually made with MRI with gadolinium contrast or contrast-enhanced multiphase CT scan; percutaneous biopsy is often discouraged due to bleeding risk.\n- Patients with HCA taking oral contraceptives should discontinue them as the first line of treatment.\n- Most patients will experience HCA regression after discontinuing oral contraceptives, and no further intervention is necessary if the HCA is smaller than 5 cm or regresses to that size.\n- Liver resection is reserved for large tumors remaining >5 cm despite other treatment or with features suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma.\n- Resection is also considered in male patients with HCA of any size due to higher malignancy risk.\n- Urgent surgery or angioembolization may be needed for bleeding HCA."

            "explanation": "- Acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) is severe gallbladder inflammation without obstructing gallstones, common in critically ill patients.\n- AAC carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality; diagnosis is often delayed due to focus on the patient's critical condition.\n- Patients typically present with right upper quadrant pain and tenderness; diagnosis is suggested by ultrasonographic findings like a distended gallbladder with thickened wall and pericholecystic fluid.\n- Acute intervention (gallbladder removal or drainage) is indicated.\n- AAC often develops with other organ system derangements, making percutaneous cholecystostomy an attractive treatment over cholecystectomy.\n- Open cholecystectomy in critically ill AAC patients is associated with high morbidity and mortality.\n- Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, though less invasive, requires general anesthesia, carries surgical risks after a recent myocardial infarction (as in this patient), and has high conversion rates to open surgery in AAC patients.\n- Percutaneous cholecystostomy is the best treatment option, providing immediate treatment under local anesthesia with ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance.\n- AAC is not an obstructive biliary tree disease, so ERCP with sphincterotomy is not needed for diagnosis or treatment.\n- MRCP can suggest diagnosis and confirm absence of gallstones but does not provide appropriate treatment."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- Inadvertent PEG placement into the colon occurs when the colon overlies the anterior gastric wall.\n- If detected early, the malpositioned PEG should be removed, the colonic injury repaired, and a new gastrostomy placed.\n- This procedure allows both repair of the colonic perforation and accurate placement of a new gastrostomy for nutritional support.\n- PEG removal via colonoscopy is not optimal in this case because the PEG was placed only 3 days ago, and there is no chronic tract to the skin with colocutaneous fistula; colonic perforation repair is required.\n- Attempts to remove PEG by cutdown through the anterior abdominal wall will result in a larger colonic perforation because the PEG has a larger internal bumper than the colonic lumen.\n- Repeat upper endoscopy with PEG placement is inappropriate due to prior complication and need for visualization for gastrostomy placement.\n- Jejunostomy is not indicated as there is no contraindication to gastrostomy and gastric feeding.\n- Methods to avoid PEG misplacement include reverse Trendelenburg position, adequate stomach insufflation, digital reflex confirmation, and light reflex with transillumination."

            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "- Posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release (TAR) is a versatile, effective technique for ventral hernia repair.\n- TAR avoids large skin flaps and starts by entering the posterior rectus sheath to develop a retrorectus plane.\n- This plane can be dissected superiorly to the diaphragm's central tendon and inferiorly to the space of Retzius.\n- Lateral dissection extends to 1 cm medial to the linea semilunaris, preserving neurovascular bundles.\n- After identifying and dividing transversus abdominis muscle fibers, the dissection continues laterally to the psoas muscle.\n- After bilateral TAR, the posterior rectus sheath is closed in the midline to isolate visceral contents from prosthetic mesh placement.\n- Closure of the posterior rectus sheath creates space for a large piece of mesh in a sublay retromuscular position.\n- After mesh implantation, the rectus muscle and anterior rectus sheath are closed above the mesh to restore the midline abdominal wall.\n- Risk for mesh infection may be reduced with TAR due to native tissue presence on both sides of the prosthetic mesh.\n- Intraperitoneal onlay mesh exposes the mesh to visceral contents.\n- In anterior component separation, mesh is placed either as an onlay over midline fascia closure or as an underlay in a retrorectus position, which carries potential risk of bowel herniation around mesh edges."

            "answer": "E",
            "explanation": "- Common postoperative complications after herniorrhaphy are surgical site infections (SSIs) and hernia recurrence, which increase with wound contamination.\n- Historically, acellular dermal matrix (ADM) was hypothesized to reduce infected mesh instances in contaminated wounds.\n- Due to ADM's higher cost, some surgeons choose synthetic mesh even with wound contamination.\n- Financial considerations have led to selective ADM use, limited to herniorrhaphies most likely to benefit from biologic mesh.\n- A study with 359 patients showed ADM use resulted in lower SSI rates for abdominal wall repair in heavy contamination, such as with enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) repair.\n- In these cases, ADM showed lower infection rates, less hernia recurrence, and fewer complications compared to synthetic mesh.\n- These data support ADM use over synthetic mesh for complex abdominal wall repair in heavy wound contamination or with concomitant ECF repair.\n- A separate study showed it was safe to repair both abdominal wall hernia and ECF in a single operation, and biologic mesh offered lower rates of fistula recurrence compared with synthetic mesh.\n- Abdominal wall repair generally has lower recurrence and SSI rates when primary fascial closure is reinforced with mesh, rather than bridged mesh repair.\n- Even with ADM, SSI and recurrence are high for bridged repairs.\n- Synthetic mesh has high success rates for augmenting crural closure, repairing parastomal hernias, and reinforcing primary closure in abdominal wall repair.\n- Thus, there appears to be no advantage in using more expensive ADM in these settings, except for cases with heavy contamination or ECF."
