            "explanation": "- Anal fissures are a common cause of anal pain and minor anorectal bleeding, often associated with hard bowel movements, and typically located in the posterior midline.\n- Chronic anal fissures (symptoms > 6 weeks) often have a distal skin tag or proximal hypertrophied anal papilla, and internal sphincter fibers may be visible.\n- Acute fissures generally heal with supportive care, but after 6 weeks, healing rates decrease, often requiring further therapy.\n- The primary objective of all therapeutic options is to relax the anal sphincter.\n- Medical options (topical nitric oxide donors, calcium channel blockers) have limited efficacy and common recurrence.\n- For continued symptoms, surgery offers the highest healing rates; lateral internal sphincterotomy is the most successful surgery.\n- Botulinum toxin is less effective than lateral internal sphincterotomy and is reserved for patients who refuse surgery or are at high risk for incontinence.\n- Posterior sphincterotomy is associated with poor wound healing and \"keyhole\" deformity, and has been abandoned as a surgical option.\n- Given the patient's chronic symptoms, failed conservative measures, and no risk factors for incontinence, a lateral internal sphincterotomy is the most appropriate next step."
