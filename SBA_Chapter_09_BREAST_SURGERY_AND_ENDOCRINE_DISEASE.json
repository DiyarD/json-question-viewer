            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "Fibroadenomas classically present in females below the age of 35 and are infrequent after the age of 35–40. They are described as painless, rubbery to firm, non-fluctuant, discrete mobile breast lumps commonly referred to as ‘breast mice'. Breast cysts occur more frequently after the age of 35 and may present with breast pain. They can be fluctuant if fluid filled and characteristically are tense, discrete, mobile lumps. Carcinoma of the breast is rare under the age of 35, and usually presents as a solitary, painless, ill-defined lump of varying size which may show signs of skin tethering. Lipomas, although very common, are usually soft, fluctuant, irregularly defined lumps. Sebaceous cysts are typically round, soft lumps attached to the skin and have a central punctum."

            "answer": "A",
            "explanation": "The most likely answer here is fat necrosis. Although the irregularity and hardness of the breast lump with overlying skin tethering suggests breast carcinoma, the history of recent trauma coupled with overlying breast lump tenderness and bruising indicates fat necrosis rather than breast cyst, fibroadenosis and breast abscess. Breast cyst, fibroadenosis and breast abscess are all unlikely here because of the history."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "Lactational breast abscesses are caused by the skin's commensal micro-organisms, nearly always staphylococci, infiltrating cracks in the nipple during breastfeeding. Segmental breast inflammation occurs, leading to cellulitis which, if not treated promptly, results in breast tissue necrosis, pus build up and abscess formation within the breast segment. Continuous pain and sleepless nights coupled with the hard 3 cm painful lump suggest an abscess rather than acute mastitis. Fat necrosis is unlikely here with no history of previous minor local trauma. Periductal mastitis is possible, but classically occurs in non-lactating women of reproductive age and is associated with smoking. From the nature of the history and physical examination findings, it is unlikely to be a breast cyst."

            "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis here is breast carcinoma. The patient is in her sixth decade with a nulliparous history. Furthermore, blood-stained nipple discharge coupled with the non-tender breast lump place her at high risk of breast cancer. Milky to dirty-green nipple discharge is usually seen with mammary duct ectasia (common in postmenopausal women) and often, but not always, occurs bilaterally. Acute and periductal mastitis are unlikely here due to the absence of mastalgia. Although duct papillomas are relatively common causes of blood-stained discharge, they do not classically present with a breast lump and other symptoms are rarely present. Owing to the similar presentation of breast carcinoma, it is difficult to distinguish it from a duct papilloma by clinical examination alone."

            "explanation": "Breast cysts usually occur in women over the age of 40 years through to the menopause. The aetiology in unclear, but it is thought that they occur due to hormonal imbalances around the menopause. Not all breast cysts manifest as pre-menstrual tenderness. The lump is mobile and fluctuant, suggesting that it is a fluid-filled cyst. Fibroadenomas classically present in females below the age of 35 and are infrequent after the age of 35–40. Fibroadenosis presents at a similar age, however the lump is fluctuant, making it more likely to be a cyst. Fat necrosis is unlikely here in the absence of previous minor local trauma (which is not stated in the history). Periductal mastitis is commonly seen in non-lactating women in their thirties (with a history of smoking) with pain usually developing in the areolar area."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "This presentation is typical of mammary duct ectasia, which is common in the decade around the menopause. The nipple discharge can vary, ranging from milky, brown to a dirty green colour. The nipple discharge can be bilateral and occasionally it is associated with cyclical mastalgia. The history of nipple retraction can cause confusion, leading the clinician to suspect breast carcinoma. However, the presence of the slit in the nipple, coupled with the colour of the nipple discharge and the perimenopausal age of the patient, make it more likely to be duct ectasia. Galactorrhoea is unlikely here as nipple discharge is usually bilateral and milky in appearance and this usually follows lactation. Duct papillomas usually present with blood-stained nipple discharge. Fibroadenoma does not usually present with nipple discharge and is common in women under the age of 35."

            ],
            "answer": "C",
            "explanation": "All breast lumps are investigated using 'triple assessment' which involves clinical examination, ultrasound breast scans for women younger than 35 (due to relatively denser breast tissue) or mammograms for women older than 35, followed by fine needle aspiration cytology and/or core biopsy for cytological and histological assessment, respectively. Women over the age of 35 tend to have less dense breast tissue, which increases the sensitivity and specificity of mammography. This patient is 25, which coupled with the discovery of two new lumps, indicates that the next line investigation, following clinical examination, would be an ultrasound of the left breast. Mammography would not be suitable as this patient is under the age of 35. Reassurance and discharge is clearly wrong as all breast lumps should undergo triple assessment before the patient is discharged. Fine needle aspiration and core biopsy, although they will be carried out, are not considered until radiological assessment has been performed."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The most likely answer here is a malignant phyllodes tumour which accounts for 0.5% of all breast tumours. The recent increase in size of the right breast coupled with the discovery of a non-tender, mobile lump, giving the right breast a ‘tear drop' appearance, is suggestive of a malignant phyllodes tumour. Phyllodes tumours have many of the clinical and histological features of fibroadenomas (which are common in women in their early to late twenties). Inflammatory breast carcinoma, as its name suggests, is associated with pain (unlike other breast cancers), breast erythema, peau d'orange (the skin overlying the breast resembles that of red-coloured orange peel) and skin ridging with or without a palpable mass. Paget's disease of the nipple presents as a unilateral, non-itchy, irregular eczematoid eruption of the nipple. It can be easily confused with eczema of the nipple, which usually occurs bilaterally, with pruritus, and can be nipple sparing. Breast abscess is unlikely here, and for more information, please refer to the answer to Question 2."

The non-itchy, eczematoid changes in the overlying skin of the right nipple and accompanying lymphadenopathy suggests underlying breast malignancy rather than eczema. Paget's disease of the nipple is almost always associated with an underlying intraductal or invasive carcinoma. Early BCC lesions consist of raised pearly pink papules with fine overlying areas of telangiectasia. Late BCC lesions gradually ulcerate and are often referred to as 'rodent ulcers'. A malignant phyllodes tumour is unlikely here due to the absence of a lump and increase in size of the breast. Mastitis and breast abscess are also unlikely due to the presenting history and clinical findings (please refer to the answer to Question 2)."

            "explanation": "The history of bilateral cyclical breast pain, which gradually intensifies before the start of the menses, and which is relieved once the menses start, is highly suggestive of cyclical mastalgia. The absolute cause of this condition is not yet clear, although it is thought to arise due to the sensitivity and responsiveness of breast tissue to hormones. Non-cyclical mastalgia does not fit the history as it is not usually associated with the menstrual cycle. Tietze's syndrome is characterized by tenderness usually over the second, third or fourth costochondral junctions because of chondritis of the costal cartilages. Acute bacterial mastitis is possible, but usually does not present bilaterally and is not associated with the menstrual cycle. The affected breast is usually erythematous, swollen and extremely tender. Traumatic fat necrosis is clearly wrong as there is no history of recent trauma to the breasts."

            "explanation": "Flucloxacillin is the antibiotic of choice for treating lactational acute mastitis. The crack in the left nipple allows invasion by skin commensal Staphylococcus aureus, the most common cause of breast infection. Flucloxacillin is a penicillinase-resistant antibiotic that is very effective against S. aureus infections. Breastfeeding or milk expression is still encouraged during treatment and has shown to quicken recovery. Amoxicillin (from the penicillin family), and ciprofloxacin (from the quinolone family) are ineffective against S. aureus. Erythromycin (from the macrolide family) is usually administered to patients who are allergic to penicillin formulas. It is not as effective as penicillinase-resistant antibiotics against S. aureus. Cephalexin (from the cephalosporin family), a moderate-spectrum antibiotic, can be used for S. aureus infections. However, cephalosporins are not considered a first line antibiotic therapy for the treatment of breast abscesses due to moderate-spectrum activity. In this case, the patient is not allergic to penicillin and thus flucloxacillin is the more appropriate choice of treatment."

            "explanation": "Mammary duct ectasia does not warrant treatment providing investigations are normal. Duct excision is only performed if the discharge is frequent and excessive. Antibiotic therapy is not usually a treatment option for this condition and will not provide a cure. Performing a mammography in 3 months is unlikely to be beneficial. Mastectomy of the right breast is not a recommended treatment modality."

            "explanation": "Although mastectomy and mastectomy + postoperative radiotherapy are accepted treatment options for DCIS, wide local excision + postoperative radiotherapy is now frequently offered to women with tumours less than 40 mm in diameter of not an aggressive grade. Wide local excision attempts to conserve the unaffected breast tissue, thus avoiding the need for complete mastectomy, which carries greater psychological trauma to the patient. Mastectomy + postoperative radiotherapy is offered when DCIS is found in multiple areas of the breast, the tumour grade is aggressive, the size of the tumour is greater than 40 mm and if the oestrogen receptor status is negative. Ductal carcinoma in situ implies that the tumour is still confined to the basement membrane and has not broken through the latter. Thus axillary lymph nodes are at a greater chance of being affected once the tumour has broken through the basement membrane. With some exceptions, axillary staging and clearance is performed when multiple foci of extensive and aggressive DCIS are found."

            "answer": "D",
            "explanation": "The patient has a unifocal 2.5 cm malignant tumour in the right breast. The most appropriate management would be to perform a wide local excision of the breast tumour and it is essential to establish whether axillary disease is present or not. To assess disease positivity/negativity in the axilla, sentinel node biopsy should be performed. If the axillary sentinel lymph node is involved with metastatic tumour deposits originating from the primary breast tumour (e.g. macrometastases; tumour deposits. 2 mm), depending on the level of involvement of the axilla, the patient will undergo axillary clearance. This involves removing level 1-3 axillary lymph nodes to remove residual malignancy. It is not common practice for a patient diagnosed with breast cancer to undergo axillary clearance if the axilla has not been assessed. In some cases, an axillary lymph node FNA cytology assessment may be performed if there is palpable axillary disease. If the result confirms malignant disease, then the patient will undergo axillary clearance. Otherwise, sentinel node biopsy is usually performed to plan, whether the patient requires axillary clearance. The main indications for mastectomy are patients who have large tumours (>5 cm) that are unresponsive to chemotherapy, multifocal breast tumours, diffuse DCIS, and a large tumour relative to the patient's breast tissue."

            ],
            "answer": "B",
            "explanation": "The treatment options for male breast cancer are similar to those for female breast cancer. The most common form of breast cancer in males is invasive ductal carcinoma, which is also the most common type in women. There are four clinical stages of ductal carcinoma and determining the clinical stage allows for the selection of initial treatment. Patients who have stage 1 or 2 (early breast cancer) are more suitable for surgery whereas surgery should be avoided in patients who have stage 3 and 4 breast cancer, that is locally advanced cancer or metastatic spread at presentation, respectively, and they should be treated with chemotherapy. In this case, the patient has stage 2 breast cancer, implying that he is suitable for surgery. In addition, this tumour is oestrogen receptor positive; 90% of male breast cancers are oestrogen receptor positive. Mastectomy + axillary clearance, followed by systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and Tamoxifen, is the most suitable answer out of the five options. Chest wall radiotherapy coupled with systemic chemotherapy carries a better prognosis for the patient. Mastectomy alone would ensure tumour removal, but would not ensure the clearance of micrometastases, and the risk of recurrence/metastases would be higher without chemo/radiotherapy. Wide local excision would be difficult due to the invasive nature of the tumour and ensuring tumour clear margins of tissue. Mastectomy + radiotherapy is possible, but the addition of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy with Tamoxifen carries a better prognosis because of the higher likelihood of removal of micrometastases. Patients who have stage 4 breast cancer (metastases at presentation) are usually offered palliative care."

In some cases, if the Radiologist suspects that the cyst has indeterminate features, the aspirated cystic fluid be sent off for cytological analysis (if but in some cases the fluid may be blood). Breast MRI is used in the assessment of multifocal/ bilateral disease and also in patients with cosmetic implants who are at a predisposed risk of breast cancer.

From the patient's history, she had suffered a head injury (the triggering factor for her symptoms) and after 2 weeks her symptoms started. The fact that she has no other symptoms makes it likely that this patient is suffering from diabetes insipidus, where vast amounts of dilute urine are secreted. Two forms exist: cranial diabetes insipidus (causes include head injury, cranial surgery, sarcoidosis), where there is a lack of ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary gland; and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (causes include hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia, drugs such as lithium and demecycline, genetic defects and heavy metal poisoning), where there is a lack of response of the kidneys to ADH. Diagnosis can be confirmed using the water deprivation test. This patient has cranial diabetes insipidus. From the list of options, the most likely answer is treatment with desmopressin (a synthetic analogue of ADH). Carbimazole is given to patients with hyperthyroidism. Spironolactone, in the context of endocrine medicine, is given to patients with Conn's syndrome. Thyroxine is given to hypothyroid patients and octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) can be used in patients with excessive growth hormone production (e.g. acromegaly) and patients with carcinoid syndrome."
